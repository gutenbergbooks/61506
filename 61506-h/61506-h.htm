<h2>LETTER XXXII.</h2>

<p class="gist"><i>High-street, Oxford.—Dress of the Oxonians.—Christ

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">D</span>.
has a relation at one of the colleges,
to whom he dispatched a note immediately
upon our arrival. By the time tea was
ready he was with us. It must be admitted,
that though the English are in general
inhospitable towards foreigners, no people
can be more courteous to those who are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
properly introduced. The young student
told us that he should show us the University
with as much pleasure as we could see
it; for he had abstained from visiting
many things himself, till he should have
a lion to take with him. Upon enquiring
the meaning of this strange term, I found
that I was a lion myself; it is the name
for a stranger in Oxford.</p>

<p>The High-street, in which our inn is
situated, is said to be the finest street in
Europe. The Calle de Alcala is longer,
broader, straighter, and, were the trees in
the Prado of tolerable size, would have a
finer termination. In point of fine buildings,
I should suppose no street can be
compared with this; but the whole cannot
be seen at once, because it is not sufficiently
straight.</p>

<p>The dress of the collegians is picturesque;
that which the great body of students
wear is not unlike that of a secular priest.
The cap is square, worn diagonally, covered
with black cloth, and has a silk tassel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
in the middle: noblemen have the tassel
of gold. It is graceful, but inconvenient,
being of no use against sun, wind,
or rain. Every degree has its distinguishing
habit; they are not numerous, and all are
of the same colour. I was the more sensible
of the beauty of this collegiate costume,
as cloaks are not worn in this country:
there are no monastics, and the clergy
are not to be distinguished from the
laity; so that there is a total want of drapery
in the dress of Englishmen every
where, except in the universities.</p>

<p>We went after tea to a walk belonging
to the college of Christ Church, a foundation
of the famous Wolsey, who thus
made some compensation to literature,
and, as he thought, to the church, for the
injury which he had done them. The
foundation has been greatly increased;—it
has a modern square, finely built, with a
modern gateway leading to it; but modern
buildings are not in keeping with the monastic
character of the place. Our monasteries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
indeed, are rarely or never so
beautiful as these colleges: these are lighter,
without being the less venerable in appearance,
and have that propriety about
them which characterizes every thing English.
The greater part of Christ Church
college is antient; nothing can be finer
than the great gateway, the great square,
and the open ascent to the refectory, though
the great square is debased by a little miserable
fountain of green and stinking water
in the centre, so pitiful, that the famous
<i>Mannekè</i> of Brussels might well be
placed in the midst of it, as the appropriate
god of the puddle.</p>

<p>The walk belonging to this college is
truly beautiful: a long avenue of fine old
elms, whose boughs form a perfect arch
in the vista, well exemplifying the hypothesis,
that Gothic church architecture
was designed to imitate the places where
the Pagan Goths worshipped in the forest.
At the termination of the walk a narrower
way trends off, and winds round a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
meadow by the side of the Isis, a river as
much celebrated by the English poets, as
the Mondego by the Portuguese. Nothing
could be conceived more cheerful than the
scene: a number of pleasure-boats were
gliding in all directions upon this clear and
rapid stream; some with spread sails; in
others the caps and tassels of the students
formed a curious contrast with their employment
at the oar. Many of the smaller
boats had only a single person in each; and
in some of these he sat face forward, leaning
back as in a chair, and plying with
both hands a double-bladed oar in alternate
strokes, so that his motion was like the
path of a serpent. One of these canoes
is, I was assured, so exceedingly light,
that a man can carry it; but few persons
are skilful or venturous enough to use it.
Just where the river approaches nearest to
the city, an old indented bridge stretches
across, and a little fall cuts off all communication
by boats with the upper part.
Several smaller bridges over branches of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
the river were in sight, on some of which
houses are built. On one of these formerly
stood the study of Roger Bacon, the celebrated
Franciscan. It was said, that
whenever a wiser than he should pass under
it, it would fall upon his head. I know
not whether he who ordered its demolition
was under any personal apprehensions, but
it has been pulled down, not many years
ago. It might have stood another millennium
before the prediction would have
been accomplished.</p>

<p>Our land view was not less interesting,
nor less cheerful, than that towards the
water. The winding walk was planted,
with trees well disposed in groups, and all
flourishing in a genial soil and climate:
some poplars among them are of remarkable
growth. Here the students were seen
in great numbers; some with flowing
gowns, others having rolled them up behind,
others again with the folds gathered
up and flung loosely over the arm. Spires,
and towers, and pinnacles, and the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
dome of the Radcliffe library, appeared
over the high elms. The banks of Ilyssus,
and the groves of Academus, could never
have presented a sight more beautiful.</p>

<p>We walked till nine o'clock was announced
by Great Tom, as the bell of
Christ Church college is called: probably
the last bell in the kingdom which has
been baptized. It is of great size, and its
tone full and sonorous. This is the supper
hour in the colleges, after which the gates
are shut. The names of those students
who return late are taken down, and reported
to the master; and if the irregularity
be often repeated, the offender receives
a reprimand. Order seems to be
maintained here without severity; I heard
no complaint of discipline from the young
men, and the tutors on their part have as
little reason to be displeased.</p>

<p>The next morning when I awoke, so
many bells were chiming for church service,
that for a while I wondered where I
was, and could not immediately believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
myself to be in England. We breakfasted
with our fellow-traveller at Lincoln. This
is a small and gloomy college; but our
friend's apartments far exceeded in convenience
and propriety, any which I have
ever seen in a convent. The tea-kettle
was kept boiling on a chafing-dish; the
butter of this place is remarkably good;
and we had each a little loaf set before us,
called by the singular name of George
Brown.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span>
One man, whom they call a
scout, waits upon the residents; another is
the bed-maker. Service is performed in
the chapels twice every day, at seven in
the morning, and at five in the afternoon.
The fellows lose their fellowships if they
marry. It is surprising that so much of
the original institution should still be preserved.
A figure of the devil formerly
stood upon this college; why placed there
I have not learnt; but it is still a proverbial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
phrase to say of one who shows displeasure
in his countenance, that he looks
like the devil over Lincoln. Another college
here has the whimsical ornament of a
brazen nose on its gateway, from which it
derives its name.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the students go to their
tutor, and continue with him an hour. At
eleven therefore we called upon D.'s relation
at Baliol college, which, though not
large, nor of the handsomest order, is
very neat, and has of late received many
improvements, in perfectly good taste.
The refectory is newly built, in the Gothic
style; nothing can be less ornamented,
yet nothing seems to need ornament less.
There are four long tables, with benches
for the students and bachelors. The fellow's
table is on the dais at the upper end;
their chairs are, beyond comparison, the
easiest in which I ever sate down, though
made entirely of wood: the seats are slightly
concave from side to side; I know not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
how else to describe their peculiarity of
construction, yet some thought and some
experience must have been requisite to
have attained to their perfection of easiness,
and there may be a secret in the form
which I did not discover. The chapel has
some splendid windows of painted glass:
in one, which represents the baptism of
Queen Candace's eunuch, the pearl in the
Ethiop's ear was pointed out to me as peculiarly
well executed.</p>

<p>Our friend told us that Cranmer and
Latimer were burnt before the gateway of
this college, in bloody Queen Mary's days,
by which name they always designate the
sister of the bloody Elizabeth. I could
not refrain from observing that these persecutors
only drank of the same cup which
they had administered to others, and reminded
him of the blessed John Forrest,
at whose martyrdom these very men had
assisted as promoters, when he and the
image of Christ were consumed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
same fire! It is truly astonishing to see
how ignorant the English are of their own
ecclesiastical history.</p>

<p>From hence we went to the adjoining
college, which is dedicated to the Holy
Trinity. The garden here is remarkable
for a wall of yew, which encloses it on
three sides, cut into regular pilasters and
compartments. D. cried out against it,
but I should lament if a thing, which is
so perfect in its kind, and which has been
raised with so many years of care—indeed,
so many generations—were to be destroyed,
because it does not suit with the modern
improved taste in gardening. You would
hardly conceive that a vegetable wall could
be so close and impervious, still less, that
any thing so unnatural could be so beautiful
as this really is. We visited the
gardens of two other colleges. In those
of New College, the college arms were
formerly cut in box, and the alphabet
grew round them; in another compartment
was a sun-dial in box, set round with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
true lovers' knots. These have been destroyed,
more easily as well as more rapidly
than they were formed; but as nothing
beautiful has been substituted in
their places, it had been better if they had
suffered these old oddities to have remained.
One proof of their predecessors' whimsical
taste has however been permitted to
stand; a row of trees, every one of which
has its lower branches grafted into its next
neighbour, so that the whole are in this
way united. The chapel here is the most
beautiful thing in the university: it was
repaired about ten years ago: and when
the workmen were preparing the wall to
set up a new altar-piece, they discovered
the old one, which had been plastered up
in the days of fanaticism, and which, to
the honour of the modern architect, is said
to have differed little in design from that
which he was about to have erected in its
place. The whole is exquisitely beautiful;
yet I have heard Englishmen say that
new Gothic, and even old Gothic dust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
renovated, never produces the same effect
as the same building would do, with the
mellowed colouring, the dust, and the
crumbliness of age. The colouring, they
say, is too uniform, wanting the stains
which time would give it: the stone too
sharp, too fresh from the chisel. This is
the mere prejudice of old habits. They
object with better reason to a Gothic organ,
so shaped that a new painted window
can be seen through it, as in a frame: a
device fitter for stage effect than for a chapel.
The window itself, which is exceedingly
beautiful, was designed by Sir Joshua
Reynolds, the great English master.</p>

<p>The other garden to which we were led,
was that of St John's; it is laid out in the
modern taste, with a grass lawn, winding
walks, and beds of flowers and flowering
shrubs. High elms, apparently coeval
with the building itself, grow in its
front, the back looks into the garden; and
this view is that which I should select, of
all others, as giving the best idea of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
beauty and character of the English colleges.</p>

<p>We dined with our friend at Baliol, in
the refectory. Instead of assembling there
at the grace, we went into the kitchen,
where each person orders his own mess
from what the cook has provided, every
thing having its specific price. The expenses
of the week are limited to a certain
sum, and if this be exceeded the transgressor
is reprimanded. I was well pleased
at this opportunity of becoming acquainted
with the œconomy of the colleges. The
scene itself was curious: the kitchen was
as large as that of a large convent; the
grate of a prodigious size, because roast
meat is the chief food of the English; it
was so much shallower than any which I
had seen in private families, as to consume
comparatively but little coal; and the bars,
contrary to the usual practice, placed perpendicularly.
The cook's knife was nearly
as long as a small sword, and it bent like
a foil. The students order their messes according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
to seniority: but this custom was
waived in our friend's favour, in courtesy
to us as strangers. Every thing was served
with that propriety which is peculiar to
the English; we ate off pewter, a relic of
old customs, and drank from silver cups.</p>

<p>I observed that the person who waited
on us wore a gown, and had the appearance
of a gentleman. On enquiry, I learnt
that he was one of a class called servitors,
who receive their education gratuitously,
and enjoy certain pensions on condition of
tolling the bell, waiting at table, and performing
other menial offices. They are
the sons of parents in low life, and are thus
educated for the inferior clergy. When
we talked upon this subject, D. said that
he felt unpleasantly at calling to a man as
well educated as himself, and of manners
equally good, to bring him a piece of bread
or a cup of beer. To this it was replied,
that these persons, being humbly born,
feel no humiliation in their office; that in
fact it is none, but rather an advancement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
in life; that this was the tenure on which
they held situations which were certainly
desirable, and enjoyed advantages which
would not else have been within their
reach; and that many eminent men in the
English church, among others the present
primate himself, had risen from this humble
station.</p>

<p>After dinner we adjourned to our friend's
rooms. A small party had been invited to
meet us: wine was set on the table in readiness,
and fruit handed round. This, it
seems, is the regular way of passing the
afternoon. The chapel bell rung at five
for evening service; some of our party
left us at this summons; others remained,
being permitted to absent themselves occasionally;
a relaxation easily granted where
attendance is looked upon as a mere matter
of form, not as an act of religion.</p>

<p>Tea was served as in a private family,
the English never dispensing with this
meal. We then walked out, and ascending
a hill close to the city, enjoyed a magnificent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
prospect of its towers and trees
and winding waters. About ten there began
one of the most glorious illuminations
which it is possible to conceive,—far more
so than the art of man can imitate. The
day had been unusually hot, and the summer
lightning was more rapid and more
vivid than I had ever before seen it.
We remained till midnight in the great
street, watching it as it played over the
bridge and the tower of St Magdalen's
church. The tower, the bridge, the trees,
and the long street were made as distinct
as at noon-day, only without the colours
of day, and with darker shadows,—the
shadows, indeed, being utterly black. The
lightning came not in flashes, but in sheets
of flame, quivering and hanging in the
sky with visible duration. At times it
seemed as if the heavens had opened to the
right and left, and permitted a momentary
sight of the throne of fire.</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">S</span><span class="smc">chool</span>
and college are not united in the
English universities. Students are not admitted
till their school education is completed,
which is usually between the age
of seventeen and nineteen. Four years
are then to be passed at college before the
student can graduate; and till he has graduated
he cannot receive holy orders, nor
till he has attained the age of twenty-two
years and a half. Formerly they went
younger: the statutes forbid them to play
at certain games in the streets, which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
exclusively the amusement of children;
but when the statutes were made, there
were few other schools. The examinations
preparatory to graduation were, till
within these three or four years, so trifling
as to be the opprobrium of Oxford. Some
score of syllogisms were handed down
from one generation to another; the candidate
chose which of these he pleased to
be examined in, and any two books in the
learned languages. Any master of arts
who happened to come into the schools
might examine him. It was usually contrived
to have a friend ready, lest too
much might be expected, and not unfrequently
nothing was done,—the champion
had appeared in the lists, and that was
enough. A great change has just taken
place, and the examination is now so serious
and severe, that the present generation
speak with envy of the happy days of
their predecessors.</p>

<p>At one of the colleges a needle and
thread is given to every member on New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
Year's Day, with this admonition: "Take
this, and be thrifty!" But though thrift
may be enjoined by the statutes, it is not
by the customs, of Oxford. The expence
of living here is prodigious; few have so
small a pension as 150<i>l.</i> sterling; and the
students of the privileged classes expend
four and five fold this sum. It might be
thought that in learning, as in religion,
there should be no distinction of persons.
Distinctions however there are, in the universities,
as well as in the churches; and
the noble and wealthy students are admitted
to academical honours, without passing
through the term of years which is required
from others.</p>

<p>Lectures are delivered here upon every
branch of science: the students may attend
them or not, at their own pleasure,
except those of the divinity professor; a
certificate of their attendance upon these
is required before the bishops will ordain
any candidate for orders. Degrees
are granted in law, medicine, and music;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
but law must be studied in London, medicine
in Edinburgh, and music wherever
the musician pleases. It is only for those
persons who are designed for the clergy,
that a college education is indispensable;
others are sent there because it is the custom,
and because it is convenient that
they should be under some little restraint,
and have at least the appearance of having
something to do, when they have ceased
to be boys, and are not yet men. But,
strictly speaking, Oxford is a school for
divinity, and for nothing else.</p>

<p>I cannot look upon this beautiful city—for
beautiful it is beyond my powers of language
to describe—without a deep feeling
of sorrow. The ways of Providence are
indeed mysterious! Little did the pious
founders of these noble institutions think
to what a purpose they were one day to be
made subservient: little did they think
that they were establishing seminaries
wherein their posterity were to be trained
up in heresy and schism, and disciplined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
to attack that faith, for the support of
which these stately buildings had been so
munificently endowed. That this perversion
might be complete, Catholics are excluded
from these very universities which
owe their establishment to Catholic piety.
Every person who enters is obliged to subscribe
the heterogeneous articles of the
Church of England; a law which excludes
all Dissenters, and thus shuts out no inconsiderable
part of the English youth
from the advantages of a regular education.
Yet, to do Oxford justice, it must
be admitted that the apostacy began in the
state, and was forced upon her; that she
clung to the faith till the very last, restored
it with avidity under the short sunshine
of Philip and Mary's reign, and, whenever
there has appeared any disposition towards
Catholicism in the government, has always
inclined towards it as the saving side.
More remains of the true faith are to be
found here than exist elsewhere in England,
as the frequency of church service,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
the celibacy to which the fellows are restricted,
and the prayers which are said in
every college for the souls of the founders
and benefactors. It is surprising that so
much should have been permitted to remain;
indeed, that the colleges themselves
should have been spared by the barbarous
and barbarising spirit of the founders of
the English schism, Lutherans, Calvinists,
Bucerists or Zwinglians, call them
which you will; from whichever head you
name it, it is but one beast—with more
heads than the hydra, and upon every
forehead is written Blasphemy.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>A few buildings have been added to the
city in later times,—not like the former
ones. Protestantism builds no cathedrals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
and endows no colleges. These later monuments
of liberality have had science in
view, instead of religion: the love of fame
upon earth has been the founders' motive,
not the hope of reward in heaven. The
theatre, a library, a printing-office, and an
observatory, have all been built since the
great rebellion; the last is newly erected
with the money which was designed to
supply the library with books. The Bodleian
was thought sufficient; and as there
are college libraries beside, there seems to
have been good reason for diverting the
fund to a more necessary purpose. The
Radcliffe library, therefore, as it is called,
though highly ornamental to the city, is
of little or no immediate use, the shelves
being very thinly furnished. The Bodleian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
well deserves its celebrity. It is rich in
manuscripts, especially in Oriental ones,
for which it is chiefly indebted to archbishop
Laud, a man who was so nearly a
Catholic that he lost his head in this world,
yet still so much a heretic, that it is to be
feared he has not saved his soul in the
next. Yet is this fine collection of more
celebrity than real advantage to the university.
Students are not allowed access
to it till after they have graduated, and the
graduates avail themselves so little of their
privilege, that it may be doubted whether
the books are opened often enough to save
them from the worms. In their museums
and libraries the English are not liberal;
access to them is difficult, and the books,
though not chained to the shelf, are confined
to the room. Our collections of
every kind are at the service of the public;
the doors are open, and every person, rich
or poor, may enter in. If the restrictions
in England are necessary, it must be because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
honesty is not the characteristic of
the nation.</p>

<p>The schools wherein the public examinations
are held, are also of later date than
the schism. James I. built them in a
style as mixed and monstrous as that of
his own church: all the orders are here
mingled together, with certain improvements
after the manner of the age, which
are of no order at all. At the university
printing-office, which is called the Clarendon
press, they are busied upon a superb
edition of Strabo, of which great expectations
have long been formed by the
learned. The museum contains but a poor
collection. Oliver Cromwell's skull was
shown me here, with less respect than I
felt at beholding it. Another of their curiosities
is the lanthorn which Guy Vaux
held in his hand when he was apprehended,
and the gunpowder plot detected. The
English still believe that this plot was
wholly the work of the Catholics!</p>

In reply to such instances of the author's bigotry,
which occur but too often, the words of an
old English divine may not unaptly be quoted.
"Sufficeth it us to know, that as the <i>herneshaw</i>,
when unable by main strength to grapple with the
<i>hawk</i>, doth <i>slice</i> upon her, bespattering the hawk's
wings with dung or ordure, so to conquer with her
tail what she cannot do with her bill and beak: so

cast the dung of foul language and filthy railing

coach by which we were to proceed
passes through Oxford between four and
five o'clock in the morning; we left our
baggage to be forwarded by it, and went
on one stage the preceding day, by which
means we secured a good night's rest, and
saw every thing which could be taken in
upon the way. Two of our Oxford acquaintances
bore us company: we started
soon after six, and went by water, rowing
up the main stream of the Isis, between
level shores; in some places they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
overhung with willows or alder-bushes, in
others the pasture extended to the brink;
rising ground was in view on both sides.
Large herds of cattle were grazing in these
rich meadows, and plovers in great numbers
wheeling over head. The scenery
was not remarkably beautiful, but it is always
delightful to be upon a clear stream
of fresh water in a fine summer day. We
ascended the river about a league to Godstow,
where we breakfasted at a little ale-house
by the water-side.</p>

<p>This place is celebrated for the ruins of
a nunnery, wherein Fair Rosamund was
buried, the concubine of King Henry II.,
a woman as famous for her beauty and
misfortunes as our Raquel the Jewess, or
the Inez de Castro of the Portugueze. The
popular songs say that Henry, when he
went to the wars, hid her in a labyrinth in
the adjoining park at Woodstock, to save
her from his queen. The labyrinth consisted
of subterranean vaults and passages,
which led to a tower: through this, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
the jealous wife found her way, by
means of a clue of thread, and made her
rival choose between a dagger and a bowl
of poison; she took the poison and died.
The English have many romances upon
this subject, which are exceedingly beautiful.
But the truth is, that she retired into
this convent, and there closed a life of penitence
by an edifying death. She was
buried in the middle of the quire, her tomb
covered with a silken pall, and tapers kept
burning before it, because the king for her
sake had been a great benefactor to the
church; till the bishop ordered her to be
removed as being a harlot, and therefore
unworthy so honourable a place of interment.
Her bones were once more disturbed
at the schism, when the nunnery was
dissolved; and it is certain, by the testimony
of the contemporary heretical writers
themselves, that when the leather in which
the body had been shrouded within the
leaden coffin was opened, a sweet odour
issued forth. The remains of the building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
are trifling, and the only part of the chapel
which is roofed, serves as a cow-house,
according to the usual indecency with
which such holy ruins are here profaned.
The man who showed us the place, told us
it had been built in the times of the Romans,
and seemed, as well he might, to
think they were better times than his own.
The grave of Rosamund is still shown; a
hazel tree grows over it, bearing every year
a profusion of nuts which have no kernel.
Enough of the last year's produce were
lying under the tree to satisfy me of the
truth of this, explain it how you will.</p>

<p>From hence we walked to Blenheim,
the palace which the nation built for the
famous Duke of Marlborough; a magnificent
monument of public gratitude, befitting
such a nation to erect to such a
man. The park in which it stands is three
leagues in circumference. It is the fashion
in England to keep deer within these large,
and almost waste, inclosures: the flesh of
these animals is preferred to any other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
meat; it is regarded as the choicest dainty
of the table, and the price at which it sells,
when it can be purchased, is prodigious.
They were standing in groups under the
fine trees which are always to be found in
these parks, others quietly feeding upon
the open lawn: their branching antlers,
their slender forms, their spotted skin, the
way in which they spring from the ground
and rebound as they alight, and the twinkling
motion of their tails which are never
at rest, made them beautiful accompaniments
to the scenery.</p>

<p>We went over the palace, of which,
were I to catalogue pictures, and enumerate
room after room, I might give a long
and dull account. But palaces, unless
they are technically described to gratify an
architect, are as bad subjects for description
as for painting. Be satisfied when I
say that every thing within was splendid,
sumptuous, and elegant. Would it interest
you more to read of the length,
breadth, and height of apartments, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
colour of hangings, and the subjects of
pictures which you have never seen?</p>

<p>Woodstock is near at hand; a good town,
celebrated for smaller articles of polished
steel, such as watch-chains and scissars,
and for leathern gloves and breeches of the
best quality. Here we dined: our friends
from Oxford left us after dinner, and we
proceeded about a league to Enstone, a village
where the stage would change horses
at a convenient hour on the following
morning, and where we were told there
were some water-works which would amuse
us, if we were in time to see them. To effect
this we left Woodstock the sooner. It
was but a melancholy sight. The gardens
had been made in the days of Charles I.
above a century and half ago, and every
thing about them was in a state of decay.
The water-works are of that kind which
were fashionable in the days when they
were made;—ingenious devices for wetting
the beholder from the sides, roof, floor,
and door-way of the grotto into which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
had entered, and from every object which
excited his curiosity. Our inn furnished
us with such a lodging as is called indifferent
in England: but every thing was clean,
and we had no cause for complaint. They
brought us two sorts of cheese at supper,
neither of which had I ever before met
with; the one was spotted with green,
being pleasantly flavoured with sage; the
other veined with the deep red dye of the
beet-root: this must have been merely for
ornament, for I could not perceive that
the taste was in the slightest degree affected
by the colouring. There was upon
both cheeses the figure of a dolphin, a usual
practice, for which I have never heard
any reason assigned.</p>

</div>

<p>We rose at a wholesome hour, and were
ready before six, when the coach came up.
The morning was fine, and we mounted
the roof. The country is uninteresting,
hills of neither magnitude nor beauty, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
fields intersected by stone walls. We
passed through a town called Chipping-Norton,
which stands on the side of a hill,
and then descended into a marsh, from
whence the little town on the hill side became
a fine object. A few miles beyond,
a pillar has been erected to mark the spot
where the four shires of Oxford, Warwick,
Worcester, and Gloucester meet; this latter
one we now entered. Breakfast was
ready for us at Moreton in the Marsh, a
place which seems to have little else to
support it than its situation on the high
road from Worcester to London. Before
we entered, the coachman pointed out to
us the town of Stow in the Wold, built on
a high hill to our left, where he told us
there was neither fire, water, nor earth.
Water was formerly raised from a deep
well by means of a horizontal windmill,
but this has fallen to decay.</p>

<p>The marsh ended at Moreton, and we
entered upon a country of better features.
We crossed the Campden Hills, ascending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
a long hill from Moreton, travelling about
two leagues on the top, and descending to
a little town called Broadway. From the
height we overlooked the Vale of Evesham,
or of the Red Horse, so called from the
figure of a horse cut in the side of a hill
where the soil is of that colour. This is
one of the most fertile parts of England,
yet is the vale less striking than the Vale
of Honiton—at least in the point from
which we saw it—because the inequalities,
which may render it in parts more beautiful,
prevent it from being seen as a whole.
It is remarkable in English history as the
place where Simon de Montford, son to
the Champion of the Church against the
Albigenses, was defeated and slain by
prince Edward. The town from whence
the vale derives its name is old, and has
some fine remains of an abbey, which I
wished to have examined more at leisure
than the laws of a stage-coach would allow.</p>

<p>Our road to Worcester lay through this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
highly-cultivated valley. I was delighted
with the fine pear-trees which wooded the
country, and still more by the novel appearance
of hop-yards, which I had never
before seen, and which were now in full
beauty. If this plant be less generous
and less useful than the vine, it is far more
beautiful in its culture. Long poles are
fixed into the ground in rows; each has
its separate plant, which climbs up, and
having topt, it falls down in curly tresses.
The fruit, if it may be called such, hangs
in little clusters; it resembles the cone of
the fir, or rather of the larch, in its shape,
but is of a leafy substance, and hardly
larger than an acorn. They use it in
bittering beer, though I am told that
there still exists a law which prohibits its
culture as a poisonous weed, and that in
the public breweries cheaper ingredients
are fraudulently used. Hop-picking here
is as joyous a time as our vintage. The
English have two didactic poems concerning
this favourite plant, which is more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
precarious than any other in its crop, being
liable to particular blights, so that it
often fails. It is cultivated chiefly in this
province and in Kent, and is rarely attempted
in any other part of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Malvern was in sight to the west; a
range of mountains standing in the three
provinces of Worcester, Gloucester, and
Hereford, and on the side where we beheld
them rising immediately from the
plain. This sierra is justly admired for the
beauty of its form, and its singular situation.
It is the first which I have seen in
England, nor are there any other mountains
between this and the eastern and
southern coasts. Westward the mountainous
part begins almost immediately
behind it, and extends through the whole
line of Wales. About three we reached
Worcester, a fine and flourishing city, in
the midst of this delightful country.</p>

I an epicure, I should wish to
dine every fast day at Worcester. The
Severn runs through the town, and supplies
it with salmon in abundance, the
most delicious of all fish. You would
hardly suppose that there could be any
danger from sea-monsters in bathing at
such a distance from the mouth of the river,
which is at least five-and-twenty leagues by
the course of the stream; yet about thirty
years ago a man here actually received his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
death wound in the water from a swordfish.
The fish was caught immediately
afterwards, so that the fact was ascertained
beyond a doubt.</p>

<p>Perry is the liquor of this country: a
cyder made from pears instead of apples.
The common sort when drawn from the
cask is inferior to the apple juice, but
generous perry is truly an excellent beverage.
It sparkles in the glass like Champaign,
and the people here assure me that
it has not unfrequently been sold as such
in London. I am told a circumstance concerning
the particular species of pear from
which this of the finer quality is made,
which would stagger my belief, if I did
not recollect that in such cases incredulity
is often the characteristic of ignorance.
This species is called the <i>Teignton squash</i>—(admire,
I pray you, this specimen of
English euphony!)—all the trees have
been grafted from the same original stocks
at Teignton; those stocks are now in the
last stage of decay, and all their grafts are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
decaying at the same time. They who
have made the physiology of plants their
study, (and in no other country has this
science ever been so successfully pursued
as here,) assert that with grafted trees this
always is the case; that the graft, being
part of an old tree, is not renovated by the
new stock into which it is inoculated, but
brings with it the diseases and the age of
that from which it has been taken, and
dies at the same time of natural<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span> decay.
The tree raised from seed is the progeny of
its parent, and itself a separate individual;
it begins a new lease of life. That which
is produced from a graft obtains, like a
dismembered polypus, a separate existence;
but its life, like that of the fabled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
Hamadryads, ends with that of the trunk
from which it sprung.</p>

<p>The adjoining province of Herefordshire,
with its immediate vicinity, is the great
cyder country; more and of better quality
being made here than in the West of England.
Particular attention is now paid
here by scientific men to the culture of the
apple, which they raise from seed, in conformity
to the theory just explained; they
choose the seed carefully, and even assert
that the pips from the southern chambers
of the apple are preferable to those in the
other side. In many parts of England
cyder is supposed to be an unwholesome
liquor; experience here disproves the
opinion. It is the common drink: the
people drink it freely at all times, and in
harvest times profusely: a physician of the
country says that any other liquor taken
so profusely would be hurtful, but that no
ill effects are produced by this. Madness
is said to be frequent in this province; and
those persons, who, when they find two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
things coexistent, however unconnected,
immediately suppose them to be cause
and effect, attribute it to the use of cyder.
If the fact be true, the solution is obvious;
madness is an hereditary disease: in former
times families were more stationary
than they are now, intermarriages took
place within a narrow sphere, and the inhabitants
of a whole province would, in
not many generations, all be of the same
blood.</p>

<p>A generation ago there certainly were in
these parts many poor madmen or idiots,
who, being quite harmless, were permitted
to wander whither they would, and received
charity at every house in their regular
rounds. Of one of these, his name was
Ned of the Toddin, I have just heard a
tale which has thrilled every nerve in me
from head to foot. He lived with his mother,
and there was no other in family:—it
is remarked that idiots are always particularly
beloved by their mothers, doubtless
because they always continue in a state
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
as helpless and as dependent as infancy.
This poor fellow, in return, was equally
fond of his mother; love towards her was
the only feeling of affection which he was
capable of, and that feeling was proportionately
strong. The mother fell sick and
died: of death, poor wretch, he knew nothing,
and it was in vain to hope to make
him comprehend it. He would not suffer
them to bury her, and they were obliged to
put her into the coffin unknown to him,
and carry her to the grave, when, as they
imagined, he had been decoyed away to a
distance. Ned of the Toddin, however,
suspected that something was designed;
watched them secretly, and as soon as it
was dark opened the grave, took out the
body and carried it home. Some of the
neighbours compassionately went into the
cottage to look after him: they found the
dead body seated in her own place in the
chimney corner, a large fire blazing, which
he had made to warm her, and the idiot
son with a large dish of pap offering to feed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
her.—"Eat, mother!" he was saying,—"you
used to like it!"—Presently, wondering
at her silence, he looked at the face
of the corpse, took the dead hand to feel
it, and said, "Why d'ye look so pale, mother?
why be you so cold?"</p>

</div>

<p>The main manufactory of this place is
in porcelain, and the shops in which this
ware is displayed are as splendid and as
beautiful as can possibly be imagined.
They are equal in length to a common parochial
church, and these exquisite works
of art arranged in them in the best order
upon long counters, around the sides, and
in the windows on each side the door which
occupy the whole front. In China it is
said that the prepared clay is buried in
deep pits, and left to ripen there for half a
century; by which means their porcelain
attains that semi-pellucid and pearly delicacy
which has never been equalled here.
If this be the case, the inferiority of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
English ware is accounted for. Trade in
England will not wait for such slow returns.
But if the Chinese excel them in
this particular instance, and rival them in
the vividness of their colours, they must
yield the palm in whatever depends upon
taste. One dinner service you see painted
with landscapes, every separate piece being
a different picture; another represents
flowers or fruit coloured to the life; another,
the armorial bearings of the family
for whom it has been fabricated, emblazoned
with all the richness of heraldic colouring.
These things are perfect in their
kind: yet such are the effects of prejudice
and habit, that the grotesque and tasteless
patterns of the real China are frequently
preferred; and the English copy the hair-lined
eyebrows of the Chinese, their unnatural
trees and distorted scenery, as
faithfully as if they were equally ignorant
of perspective themselves. There is however
thus much to be said in favour of this
prejudice, that plates and tea-saucers have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
made us better acquainted with the Chinese
than we are with any other distant
people. If we had no other documents
concerning this extraordinary nation, a
series of engravings from these their own
pictures would be considered as highly
curious, and such a work, if skilfully conducted
and annotated, might still elucidate
the writings of travellers, and not improbably
furnish information which it would
be in vain to seek in Europe from other
sources.</p>

<p>Another important branch of the trade
of Worcester is in leathern gloves. One
inevitable consequence of the unnatural
extension of trade in this land of commerce
is, that the slightest change of fashion reduces
so many of the labouring class to
immediate distress and ruin. Three or
four years ago the English ladies chose to
wear long silken gloves; the demand for
leathern ones immediately ceased, and the
women, whose business it was to make
them, were thrown out of employ. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
was the case of many hundreds here in
Worcester. In such cases men commonly
complain and submit; but women are
more disposed to be mutinous; they stand
less in fear of law, partly from ignorance,
partly because they presume upon the privilege
of their sex, and therefore in all
public tumults they are foremost in violence
and ferocity. Upon this occasion
they carried their point within their own
territories; it was dangerous to appear in
silken gloves in the streets of this city;
and one lady, who foolishly or ignorantly
ventured to walk abroad here in this forbidden
fashion, is said to have been seized
by the women and whipped.</p>

<p>The cathedral church of this city is a
fine Gothic edifice, which has lately undergone
a thorough repair. It is some satisfaction
to see, that if the English build
no new cathedrals, they at least preserve
the old ones, which I hope and trust are
likely to survive that schism which threatened
them with destruction, and to witness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
the revival and restoration of the true
faith, whereof they are such splendid memorials.</p>

<p>St Wulstan was the founder. His name
indeed is remembered here; but in this
church, where the shrine of the founder
was once devoutly visited, the tomb which
is now pointed out to the notice and respect
of travellers is that of the bishop who first
set the example of disobedience to king
James II. when he attempted to recall the
nation to the religion of their fathers! It
is not in this magnificent monument of
his own rearing that the history of St Wulstan is to be learnt. I have found in
the Chronicle of a Spanish Benedictine
what I should never have heard at Worcester.
This holy man was elected to the
see against his own will, nor did he accept
it till he had been convinced by signs that
it was the will of God. After some years
his enemies conspired to depose him.
There are few finer miracles in hagiology
than that which is recorded as having been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
vouchsafed upon this occasion. They
complained that he was illiterate, and
therefore unworthy of the dignity which
he held. The true cause of the accusation
was, that he was a Saxon; the Norman
conquest had been effected since his appointment
to the see, and it was wanted
for a foreigner. A council was assembled
in Westminster abbey. The king and the
Norman prelates were prejudiced judges;
and Lanfranc, the primate, though too
holy a man ever to commit an act of wilful
injustice, in his zeal for learning lent
a ready ear to the charges, and, being an
Italian, was easily deceived by the misrepresentations
of the accusers. Accordingly
he pronounced sentence of deposition
against the saint, and required him to deliver
up his ring and crosier. St Wulstan,
neither feeling dismay at heart, nor manifesting
sorrow in his countenance, rose
up as soon as sentence was pronounced
against him, and leaning upon his crosier,
replied: "Certainly I know that I am unworthy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
of my honourable office, and unequal
to the weight of my dignity; but it
is no new thing for me to know this! I
knew it and acknowledged it when my
clergy elected me; and the bishops compelled
me to accept it, and holy king Edward,
my lord, by apostolical authority, imposed
this weight upon my shoulders, and
ordered this crosier to be given into my
hands. You," said he, addressing himself
to Lanfranc, "you demand from
me the crosier which you did not give
me, and take from me the office which I
did not receive from you. I therefore, confessing
my own insufficiency, and obeying
the decree of the council, yield up my
crosier, not to you, but to him from whose
authority I received it." Saying this, he
advanced to the tomb of holy king Edward
the Confessor. "There are new laws
in this land," he exclaimed, "a new king
and new prelates, who promulgate new
sentences! They accuse thee of error, O
holy king, in promoting me, and me of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
presumption for having obeyed thee.
Then, Edward, thou couldst err, for thou
wert mortal; but now, when peradventure
thou art enjoying the presence of the Lord,
now,—canst thou now be deceived?—I
will not yield up my crosier to these from
whom I did not receive it; they are men
who may deceive and be deceived. But
to thee do I deliver it, who hast escaped
the errors and darkness of the world, and
art in the light of truth; to thee with the
best willingness I resign my pastoral staff,
and render up the charge of my flock. My
lord and king, give thou the charge to
whom thou thinkest worthy!" He then
laid the crosier upon the tomb, disrobed
himself of his episcopal insignia, and took
his seat like a private monk in the assembly.
The crosier entered the stone, as if
it had been imbedded in melting wax, and
could not be taken from it by any other
hand than by that of the holy bishop who
had laid it there.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span></p>

<p>The grave of king John is here, a monarch
remarkable in English history for
having signed the Great Charter, resigned
his crown to the pope's legate, and offered
to turn Mohammedan if the Miramolin
would assist him against his subjects.
As there were some doubts whether the
grave which was commonly supposed to
be his was really so, it was opened two or
three years ago, and the tradition verified.
It appeared that it had been opened before
for other motives; for some of the
bones were displaced, and the more valuable
parts of his dress missing. As this
was at the time when the revolutionary
disposition of the people had occasioned
some acts of unusual rigour on the part of
government, it was remarked in one of
the newspapers, that if king John had
taken the opportunity to walk abroad and
observe how things were going on, it must
have given him great satisfaction to see
how little was left of that Magna Charta,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
which he had signed so sorely against his
will.</p>

<p class="gap-above2">We waited in Worcester for the coach
from Bristol to Birmingham, which passes
through in the afternoon, and in which we
were tolerably sure of finding room, as it
is one of those huge machines which carries
sixteen withinside. Its shape is that
of a coffin<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span> placed upside-down; the door
is at the end, and the passengers sit sideways.
It is not very agreeable to enter
one of these coaches when it is nearly
full: the first comers take possession of
the places nearest the door at one end, or
the window at the other, and the middle
seats are left for those who come in
last, and who for that reason, contrary to
the parable of the labourers in the vineyard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
may literally be said to bear the heat
of the day. There were twelve passengers
already seated when we got in; they
expressed no satisfaction at this acquisition
of company; one woman exclaimed that
she was almost stewed to death already,
and another cried out to the coachman
that she hoped he would not take in any
body else. The atmosphere of the apartment,
indeed, was neither fresher nor
more fragrant than that of a prison; but
it was raining hard, and we had no alternative.
The distance was only two stages,
that is a long day's journey in our own
country, but here the easy work of five
hours; but I never before passed five
hours in travelling so unpleasantly. To
see any thing was impossible; the little
windows behind us were on a level with
our heads, the coachman's seat obstructed
the one in front, and that in the door-way
was of use only to those who sat by it.
Any attempt which we made at conversation
by way of question, was answered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
with forbidding brevity; the company was
too numerous to be communicative; half
of them went to sleep, and I endeavoured
to follow their example, as the best mode
of passing away time so profitless and so
uncomfortable. But it was in vain; heat,
noise, and motion, kept me waking. We
were heartily rejoiced when the coach arrived
at Birmingham, and we were let loose,
to stretch our limbs at liberty, and breathe
an air, cool at least, if not fresh.</p>

will look perhaps with some eagerness
for information concerning this famous
city, which Burke, the great orator
of the English, calls the grand toy-shop
of Europe. Do not blame me if I disappoint
you. I have seen much, and more
than foreigners are usually admitted to
see; but it has been too much to remember,
or indeed to comprehend satisfactorily.
I am still giddy, dizzied with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
the hammering of presses, the clatter of
engines, and the whirling of wheels; my
head aches with the multiplicity of infernal
noises, and my eyes with the light
of infernal fires,<span class="squash">——</span>I may add, my heart
also, at the sight of so many human beings
employed in infernal occupations,
and looking as if they were never destined
for any thing better. Our earth was designed
to be a seminary for young angels,
but the devil has certainly fixed upon this
spot for his own nursery-garden and hot-house.</p>

<p>You must forgive me, if I do not attempt
to describe processes which I saw
too cursorily, and with too little pleasure
to understand. A sick stomach will not
digest the food that may be forced down
it, and the intellect is as little able to
assimilate that for which it has no aptitude.</p>

<p>When we look at gold, we do not think
of the poor slaves who dug it from the caverns
of the earth; but I shall never think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
of the wealth of England, without remembering
that I have been in the mines. Not
that the labourers repine at their lot; it
is not the least evil of the system, that
they are perfectly well satisfied to be poisoned
soul and body. Foresight is not a
human instinct: the more unwholesome
the employment, the higher of course are
the wages paid to the workmen; and incredible
as it may seem, a trifling addition
to their weekly pay makes these
short-sighted wretches contend for work,
which they certainly know will in a very
few years produce disease and death, or
cripple them for the remainder of their
existence.</p>

<p>I cannot pretend to say, what is the
consumption here of the two-legged beasts
of labour; commerce sends in no returns
of its killed and wounded. Neither can
I say that the people look sickly, having
seen no other complexion in the place than
what is composed of oil and dust smoke-dried.
Every man whom I meet stinks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
of train-oil and emery. Some I have seen
with red eyes and green hair; the eyes affected
by the fires to which they are exposed,
and the hair turned green by the
brass works. You would not, however,
discover any other resemblance to a triton
in them, for water is an element with the
use of which, except to supply steam-engines,
they seem to be unacquainted.</p>

<p>The noise of Birmingham is beyond
description; the hammers seem never to
be at rest. The filth is sickening: filthy as
some of our own old towns may be, their
dirt is inoffensive; it lies in idle heaps,
which annoy none but those who walk
within the little reach of their effluvia.
But here it is active and moving, a living
principle of mischief, which fills the whole
atmosphere, and penetrates every where,
spotting and staining every thing, and
getting into the pores and nostrils. I feel
as if my throat wanted sweeping like an
English chimney. Think not, however,
that I am insensible to the wonders of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
place:—in no other age or country was
there ever so astonishing a display of human
ingenuity: but watch-chains, necklaces,
and bracelets, buttons, buckles, and
snuff-boxes, are dearly purchased at the
expence of health and morality; and if it
be considered how large a proportion of
that ingenuity is employed in making
what is hurtful as well as what is useless,
it must be confessed that human reason
has more cause at present for humiliation
than for triumph at Birmingham.</p>

<p>A regular branch of trade here is the
manufacture of guns for the African market.
They are made for about a dollar
and a half; the barrel is filled with water,
and if the water does not come through,
it is thought proof sufficient; of course
they burst when fired, and mangle the
wretched negro who has purchased them
upon the credit of English faith, and
received them most probably as the price
of human flesh! No secret is made of
this abominable trade; yet the government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
never interferes, and the persons concerned
in it are not marked and shunned as
infamous.</p>

<p>In some parts of Italy, the criminal
who can prove himself to be the best
workman in any business is pardoned <i>in
favorem artis</i>, unless his crime has been
coining; a useful sort of benefit of clergy.
If ingenuity were admitted as an excuse
for guilt in this country, the Birmingham
rogues might defy the gallows. Even as
it is, they set justice at defiance, and carry
on the most illegal practices almost with
impunity. Some spoons which had been
stolen here were traced immediately to the
receiver's house: "I know what you
are come for," said he to the persons who
entered the room in search of them, "you
are come for the spoons," and he tossed
over the crucible into the fire, because
they were not entirely melted. The officers
of justice had received intelligence
of a gang of coiners; the building to
which they were directed stood within a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
court-yard, and when they reached it they
found that the only door was on the upper
story, and could not be reached without
a ladder: a ladder was procured: it
was then some time before the door
could be forced, and they heard the people
within mocking them all this while.
When at last they had effected their entrance,
the coiners pointed to a furnace
in which all the dies and whatever else
could criminate them, had been consumed
during this delay. The coins of every
country with which England carries on
any intercourse, whether in Europe, Asia,
or America, are counterfeited here and
exported. An inexhaustible supply of
halfpence was made for home consumption,
till the new coinage put a stop to
this manufactory: it was the common
practice of the dealers in this article, to
fry a pan-full every night after supper for
the next day's delivery, thus darkening
them, to make them look as if they had
been in circulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
Assignats were forged here during the
late war; but this is less to be imputed to
the Birmingham speculators, than to those
wise politicians who devised so many
wise means of ruining France. The forgery
of their own bank notes is carried
on with systematic precautions which will
surprise you. Information of a set of
forgers had been obtained, and the officers
entered the house: they found no person
on any of the lower floors; but when they
reached the garret, one man was at work
upon the plates in the farthest room, who
could see them as soon as they had ascended
the stairs. Immediately he opened a
trap-door, and descended to the floor below;
before they could reach the spot to
follow him, he had opened a second, and
the descent was impracticable for them on
account of its depth: there they stood and
beheld him drop from floor to floor till he
reached the cellar, and effected his escape
by a subterranean passage.</p>

<p>You may well imagine what such people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
as these would be in times of popular
commotion. It was exemplified in 1791.
Their fury by good luck was in favour of
the government; they set fire to the
houses of all the more opulent dissenters
whom they suspected of disaffection, and
searched every where for the heresiarch
Priestley, carrying a spit about on which
they intended to roast him alive. Happily
for himself and for the national character,
he had taken alarm and withdrawn in
time.</p>

<p>It ought, however, to be remembered
that there is more excuse to be made for
dishonesty in Birmingham, than could be
pleaded any where else. In no other
place are there so many ingenious mechanics,
in no other place is trade so
precarious. War ruins half the manufacturers
of Birmingham by shutting their
markets. During the late war nearly
three thousand houses were left untenanted
here. Even in time of peace the
change of fashion throws hundreds out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
employ. Want comes upon them suddenly;
they cannot dig; and though they
might not be ashamed to beg, begging
would avail nothing where there are already
so many mendicants. It is not to
be expected that they will patiently be
starved, if by any ingenuity of their own
they can save themselves from starving.
When one of Shakspeare's characters is
tempted to perform an unlawful action,
he exclaims, "My poverty, but not my
will, consents." It is but just, as well as
merciful, to believe that the same extenuation
might truly be pleaded by half
the criminals who come under the rod of
the law.</p>

<p>Being a foreigner, I could not see
Messrs Bolton and Watts's great works
at Soho, which are the boast of Birmingham,
and indeed of England. As these
extraordinary men have by the invention
of the steam-engine produced so great
a change upon the commercial system,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
and thereby upon society in this country,
I could have wished to have seen their
own establishment; but it was in vain,
and I did not choose by making the trial
to expose myself to the mortification of a
refusal.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXXVII.</h2>

<p class="gist"><i>Mail Coaches.—Mr Palmer ill-used.—Vicinity
of Birmingham.—Collieries on fire.—Stafford.—Stone.—Newcastle-under-Line.—Punishments
for Scolding.—Cheshire.—Bridgewater
Arms at Manchester.</i></p>

<div class="small right1">Friday, July 9.</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">T</span><span class="smc">he</span>
mail coach which communicates
between Bristol and Manchester, leaves
Birmingham at a reasonable hour in the
morning. These coaches travel at a rate
little short of two leagues in the hour,
including all stoppages; they carry four
inside passengers, two outside; the rate of
fare is considerably higher than in other
stages; but a preference is given to these,
because they go faster, no unnecessary delays
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
are permitted, and the traveller who
goes in them can calculate his time accurately.
Every coach has its guard,
armed with a blunderbuss, who has charge
of the mails; he has a seat affixed behind
the coach, from whence he overlooks it,
and gives notice with a horn to clear the
road when any thing is in the way, to
bring out the horses when he approaches
the end of a stage, and to be ready with
the letter-bags when he enters a post-town.
Guards and coachmen all wear the
royal livery, and the royal arms are upon
the coaches.</p>

<p>It is now about twenty years since this
plan has been adopted. Before that time
the mails were carried by a single courier,
who was as long again upon the road, and
at the mercy of every footpad. They
are now perfectly safe; they go without
expense, in consequence of the profits of
the coaches: and the effect of the rapid
communication has been to double that
branch of the revenue which is derived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
from the post-office. Yet the projector
has little reason to be satisfied with the
justice of the nation. He stipulated for a
centage upon the clear increase of revenue
above a certain sum. The whole management
of the post-office was intrusted to
him; but there were two lords above him
with higher powers and higher salaries.
These places he wished to abolish as useless,
not recollecting that government desires
to have as many places at its disposal
as possible, and, instead of wanting to curtail
the number of old ones, would have
been obliged to him to have invented new.
In the struggle he was displaced himself:
so far all was fair, as he only lost the stake
for which he was playing: but advantage
was taken of this to annul the terms of the
contract between him and the nation, and
assign him 4000<i>l.</i> a-year, in lieu of his
per centage, which already amounted to a
much larger sum, and would yearly have
increased with the increasing revenue. Of
course he remonstrated against this breach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
of public faith; the cause was brought
before parliament, and it was absurdly argued
against him, that smaller pensions
than this had been deemed a sufficient reward
for their victorious admirals,—as if
rewards and contracts were of the same
nature. The minister was against him,
and parliament therefore annulled its own
contract in its own favour.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Before this plan of Mr Palmer's was
established, the ordinary pace of travelling
in England differed little from what
it still is in other countries: an able-bodied
man might walk the usual day's
journey. Its effects have not been confined
to the revenue. Other stages immediately
adopted the guard, and became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
secure from robbers; they were stimulated
to rival speed, and in consequence
improvements in coach-building of some
kind or other are every year discovered
and adopted; even waggons travel faster
now than post coaches did before this revolution.
Hence travelling consumes at
present so much less time, and is attended
by so much less fatigue, that instead of
being regarded as an evil, it is one of the
pleasures of the English; and people, as is
our case at this very time, set out upon a
journey of two hundred leagues to amuse
themselves.</p>

<p>The morning was fair, we mounted the
roof, and I looked back upon Birmingham
not without satisfaction at thinking I
should never enter it again. A heavy
cloud of smoke hung over the city, above
which in many places black columns were
sent up with prodigious force from the
steam-engines. We rejoiced that we were
travelling into a better atmosphere, but
the contagion spread far and wide. Every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
where around us, instead of the village
church, whose steeple usually adorns so
beautifully the English landscape, the
tower of some manufactory was to be
seen in the distance, vomiting up flames
and smoke, and blasting every thing
around with its metallic vapours. The
vicinity was as thickly peopled as that of
London. Instead of cottages we saw
streets of brick hovels, blackened with
the smoke of coal fires, which burn day
and night in these dismal regions. Such
swarms of children I never beheld in any
other place, nor such wretched ones,—in
rags, and their skins encrusted with soot
and filth. The face of the country as we
advanced was more hideous that can be
described, uncultivated, black and smoking.
I asked the coachman from whence
the smoke proceeded, and he told me
the whole earth beneath us was on fire;
some coal-mines had taken fire many
years ago, and still continued to burn.
"If you were to travel this road by night,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
sir," said he, "you would see the whole
country a-fire, and might fancy you were
going to hell!"—A part of the road which
is thus undermined gave way lately under
one of the stages; it did not sink deep
enough to kill the passengers by the fall,
but one of them had his thigh broken.</p>

<p>This deplorable country continued for
some leagues, till we had passed Wolverhampton,
the last manufacturing town in
this direction. Between this place and
Penkridge it improved, we were once
more in an agricultural land, and beheld
clean skins and healthy countenances. We
passed through Stafford, the county town,
a small but well-built place, of which the
main trade consists in shoes; and dined the
next stage beyond it at Stone. Here were
formerly venerated the two martyrs Wulfold
and Rufinus, who were slain by their
own father Wulpher, the Pagan king of
Mercia, the father of St Werburga also;
who, by the merits of his children, was
himself at last favoured with grace to repentance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
All traces of their worship have
long since disappeared; only the town
derives its name from the stones which
were heaped over the place of their burial.
Here we entered the country of the potteries,
from whence the greater part of
England is supplied with common ware,
and also with that finer sort called Wedgewood,
after its inventor, and known all
over Europe. Etruria is the name which
he gave to his fabric, because the Etruscan
remains were his models, and to him it
is that England, and, it may be added,
Europe,—for where do not the fashions of
England extend?—is indebted for having
familiarised to us the beautiful forms of
Etruscan design.</p>

<p>This is a populous province; in no other
part have I seen the towns standing so
near together. We soon advanced to
Newcastle-under-Line. Here my friend
the coachman told me they had a curious
custom of punishing scolds, by putting a
bridle and bitt into the mouth of the offender,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
so as to confine her tongue, and
leading her in this manner through the
streets as an example. Whether the English
women are particularly addicted to this
offence, I am not sufficiently acquainted
with them to say; but it should seem so
by the severity with which the laws regard
it. In other places immersion is the punishment;
the woman is fastened in a
chair at the end of a long plank or pole,
which is hoisted out over the river, and
there elevated or lowered by means of a lever;
in this manner they dip her as often
as the officiating constable thinks proper,
or till she no longer displays any inclination
to continue the offence, which probably
is not till she has lost the power. Both
methods are effectual ones of enforcing
silence upon an unruly tongue, but they
are barbarous customs, and ought to be
wholly disused.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
We were now entering Cheshire, the
great cheese country, and the difference
between a land of manufactures and a land
of pasturage was delightful. The houses
of the labourers were clean cottages: those
of the rich, old mansions with old trees
about them in view of the village church,
where generation after generation, for ages
back, the heirs of the family had been
baptized in the same font, and buried in
the same vault; not newly-erected brick
buildings with shrubs and saplings round
them, in hearing of the mill-wheels and
hammer, by which the fortune of the
owner has been fabricated. One house
which we passed was the most singular I
have ever seen: very old it must needs be,—how
many centuries I will not venture
to conjecture. The materials are wood
and mortar without stone; the timber-frames
painted black, and the intervening
panes of plaster-work whitened; no
dress in an old picture was ever more
curiously variegated with stripes and
slashes. The roof rises into many points;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
the upper story projecting over the lower
like a machicolated gateway, except that
the projection is far greater; and long
windows with little diamond-shaped panes
reach almost from side to side, so that
the rooms must be light as a lantern.
There is a moat round it. I should guess
it to be one of the oldest dwelling-houses
in the kingdom.</p>

<p>We saw this quiet pastoral country to
the best advantage; the sun was setting,
and the long twilight of an English summer
evening gives to the English landscape
a charm wholly its own. As soon
as it grew dark the coach lamps were
lighted; the horses have no bells, and this
is as needful for the security of other
travellers as for our own. But the roads
are wide; and if a traveller keeps his own
proper side, according to the law of the
roads, however fearful it may be to see two
of these fiery eyes coming on through
the darkness, at the rate of two leagues in
the hour, he is perfectly safe. We meant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
when evening closed, to have forsaken the
roof and taken our seats withinside; but
the places were filled by chance passengers
picked up on the way, and no choice
was left us. Star-light and a mild summer
air made the situation not unpleasant,
if we had not been weary and disposed
to sleep; this propensity it was not safe to
indulge; and the two hours after night
set in till we reached Manchester, were
the most wearying of the whole day.</p>

<p>The entrance into the city reminded me
of London, we drove so long over rough
street stones, only the streets were shorter
and the turns we made more frequent. It
was midnight when we alighted at a spacious
inn, called the Bridgewater Arms. In
these large manufacturing towns, inns have
neither the cleanliness or comfort which
we find in smaller places. In the country
there is a civility about the people of the
house, and an attention on their part,
which, though you know hospitality is
their trade, shows, or seems to show, something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
of the virtue. Here all is hurry and
bustle; customers must come in the way
of trade, and they care not whether you are
pleased or not. We were led into a long
room, hung round with great-coats, spurs,
and horsewhips, and with so many portmanteaus
and saddle-bags lying about it,
that it looked like a warehouse. Two
men were smoking over a bottle of wine
at one table; they were talking of parabolics
and elliptics, and describing diagrams
on the table with a wet finger; a
single one was writing at another, with a
large pocket-book lying open before him.
We called for supper; and he civilly told
us that he also had given a like order,
and if we would permit him should be
happy to join us. To this we of course
acceded. We found him to be a commercial
traveller, and he gave us some useful
information concerning Manchester,
and the best method of proceeding on our
journey. It was going towards two o'clock
when we retired. We slept as usual in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
a double-bedded room, but we had no
inclination to converse after we were in
bed. I fell asleep almost instantaneously,
and did not awake till nine in the morning.—I
must not forget to tell you, that
over the entrance to the passage on each
side of which the bed-rooms are arranged,
is written in large letters <i>Morphean!</i></p>

<h2>LETTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<p class="gist"><i>Manchester.—Cotton Manufactory.—Remarks
upon the pernicious Effects of the
manufacturing System.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">J.</span> <span class="smc">had</span>
provided us with letters to a
gentleman in Manchester; we delivered
them after breakfast, and were received
with that courtesy which a foreigner,
when he takes with him the expected recommendations,
is sure to experience in
England. He took us to one of the great
cotton manufactories, showed us the number
of children who were at work there,
and dwelt with delight on the infinite
good which resulted from employing
them at so early an age. I listened without
contradicting him, for who would lift
up his voice against Diana in Ephesus!—proposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
my questions in such a way
as not to imply, or at least not to advance,
any difference of opinion, and returned
with a feeling at heart which
makes me thank God I am not an Englishman.</p>

<p>There is a shrub in some of the East
Indian islands which the French call <i>veloutier</i>;
it exhales an odour that is agreeable
at a distance, becomes less so as you
draw nearer, and, when you are quite close
to it, is insupportably loathsome. Alciatus
himself could not have imagined an
emblem more appropriate to the commercial
prosperity of England.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="squash">——</span> remarked, that nothing could
be so beneficial to a country as manufactures.
"You see these children, sir,"
said he. "In most parts of England
poor children are a burthen to their parents
and to the parish; here the parish,
which would else have to support them,
is rid of all expense; they get their bread
almost as soon as they can run about, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
by the time they are seven or eight years
old bring in money. There is no idleness
among us:—they come at five in the
morning; we allow them half an hour for
breakfast, and an hour for dinner; they
leave work at six, and another set relieves
them for the night; the wheels never
stand still." I was looking while he spoke,
at the unnatural dexterity with which the
fingers of these little creatures were playing
in the machinery, half giddy myself
with the noise and the endless motion:
and when he told me there was no rest
in these walls, day nor night, I thought
that if Dante had peopled one of his hells
with children, here was a scene worthy
to have supplied him with new images of
torment.</p>

<p>"These children, then," said I, "have
no time to receive instruction." "That,
sir," he replied, "is the evil which we
have found. Girls are employed here
from the age you see them till they marry,
and then they know nothing about domestic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
work, not even how to mend a
stocking or boil a potatoe. But we are
remedying this now, and send the children
to school for an hour after they have
done work." I asked if so much confinement
did not injure their health.
"No," he replied, "they are as healthy
as any children in the world can be.
To be sure, many of them as they grew up
went off in consumptions, but consumption
was the disease of the English." I
ventured to enquire afterwards concerning
the morals of the people who were trained
up in this monstrous manner, and found,
what was to be expected, that in consequence
of herding together such numbers
of both sexes, who are utterly uninstructed
in the commonest principles
of religion and morality, they were as
debauched and profligate as human beings
under the influence of such circumstances
must inevitably be; the men drunken,
the women dissolute; that however high
the wages they earned, they were too improvident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
ever to lay-by for a time of need;
and that, though the parish was not at
the expense of maintaining them when
children, it had to provide for them in
diseases induced by their mode of life,
and in premature debility and old age; the
poor-rates were oppressively high, and the
hospitals and workhouses always full and
overflowing. I enquired how many persons
were employed in the manufactory,
and was told, children and all about two
hundred. What was the firm of the house?—There
were two partners. So! thought
I,—a hundred to one!</p>

<p>"We are well off for hands in Manchester,"
said Mr <span class="squash">——</span> ; "manufactures are
favourable to population, the poor are not
afraid of having a family here, the parishes
therefore have always plenty to apprentice,
and we take them as fast as they
can supply us. In new manufacturing
towns they find it difficult to get a supply.
Their only method is to send people round
the country to get children from their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
parents. Women usually undertake this
business; they promise the parents to
provide for the children; one party is
glad to be eased of a burthen, and it answers
well to the other to find the young
ones in food, lodging, and clothes, and receive
their wages." "But if these children
should be ill-used?" said I. "Sir,"
he replied, "it never can be the interest
of the women to use them ill, nor of the
manufacturers to permit it."</p>

<p>It would have been in vain to argue had
I been disposed to it. Mr <span class="squash">——</span> was a man
of humane and kindly nature, who would
not himself use any thing cruelly, and
judged of others by his own feelings.
I thought of the cities in Arabian romance,
where all the inhabitants were enchanted:
here Commerce is the queen
witch, and I had no talisman strong
enough to disenchant those who were
daily drinking of the golden cup of her
charms.</p>

<p>We purchase English cloth, English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
muslins, English buttons, &amp;c. and admire
the excellent skill with which they are fabricated,
and wonder that from such a distance
they can be afforded to us at so low
a price, and think what a happy country is
England! A happy country indeed it is for
the higher orders; no where have the rich so
many enjoyments, no where have the ambitious
so fair a field, no where have the
ingenious such encouragement, no where
have the intellectual such advantages;
but to talk of English happiness is like
talking of Spartan freedom, the Helots are
overlooked. In no other country can such
riches be acquired by commerce, but it is
the one who grows rich by the labour of
the hundred. The hundred human beings
like himself, as wonderfully fashioned
by Nature, gifted with the like capacities,
and equally made for immortality,
are sacrificed body and soul. Horrible as
it must needs appear, the assertion is true
to the very letter. They are deprived in
childhood of all instruction and all enjoyment;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
of the sports in which childhood
instinctively indulges, of fresh air by day
and of natural sleep by night. Their
health physical and moral is alike destroyed;
they die of diseases induced by
unremitting task-work, by confinement in
the impure atmosphere of crowded rooms,
by the particles of metallic or vegetable
dust which they are continually inhaling;
or they live to grow up without decency,
without comfort, and without hope, without
morals, without religion, and without
shame, and bring forth slaves like themselves
to tread in the same path of misery.</p>

<p>The dwellings of the labouring manufacturers
are in narrow streets and lanes,
blocked up from light and air, not, as in
our country, to exclude an insupportable
sun, but crowded together because every
inch of land is of such value, that room
for light and air cannot be afforded them.
Here in Manchester a great proportion of
the poor lodge in cellars, damp and dark,
where every kind of filth is suffered to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
accumulate, because no exertions of domestic
care can ever make such homes
decent. These places are so many hot-beds
of infection; and the poor in large
towns are rarely or never without an infectious
fever among them, a plague of
their own, which leaves the habitations of
the rich, like a Goshen of cleanliness and
comfort, unvisited.</p>

<p>Wealth flows into the country, but
how does it circulate there? Not equally
and healthfully through the whole system;
it sprouts into wens and tumours, and
collects in aneurisms which starve and
palsy the extremities. The government
indeed raises millions now as easily as it
raised thousands in the days of Elizabeth:
the metropolis is six times the size which
it was a century ago; it has nearly doubled
during the present reign; a thousand carriages
drive about the streets of London,
where, three generations ago, there were
not an hundred; a thousand hackney
coaches are licensed in the same city,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
where at the same distance of time there
was not one; they whose grandfathers
dined at noon from wooden trenchers,
and upon the produce of their own farms,
sit down by the light of waxen tapers to
be served upon silver, and to partake of
delicacies from the four quarters of the
globe. But the number of the poor, and
the sufferings of the poor, have continued
to increase; the price of every thing which
they consume has always been advancing,
and the price of labour, the only commodity
which they have to dispose of, remains
the same. Work-houses are erected
in one place, and infirmaries in another;
the poor-rates increase in proportion
to the taxes; and in times of dearth
the rich even purchase food, and retail it
to them at a reduced price, or supply
them with it gratuitously: still every year
adds to their number. Necessity is the
mother of crimes; new prisons are built,
new punishments enacted; but the poor
become year after year more numerous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
more miserable, and more depraved; and
this is the inevitable tendency of the manufacturing
system.</p>

<p>This system is the boast of England,—long
may she continue to boast it before
Spain shall rival her! Yet this is the system
which we envy, and which we are
so desirous to imitate. Happily our religion
presents one obstacle; that incessant
labour which is required in these
task-houses can never be exacted in a
Catholic country, where the Church has
wisely provided so many days of leisure for
the purposes of religion and enjoyment.
Against the frequency of these holy days
much has been said; but Heaven forbid
that the clamour of philosophizing commercialists
should prevail, and that the
Spaniard should ever be brutalized by unremitting
task-work, like the negroes in
America, and the labouring manufacturers
in England! Let us leave to England
the boast of supplying all Europe with her
wares; let us leave to these lords of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
sea the distinction of which they are so
tenacious, that of being the white slaves
of the rest of the world, and doing for it
all its dirty work. The poor must be kept
miserably poor, or such a state of things
could not continue; there must be laws
to regulate their wages, not by the value
of their work, but by the pleasures of their
masters; laws to prevent their removal
from one place to another within the kingdom,
and to prohibit their emigration
out of it. They would not be crowded in
hot task-houses by day, and herded together
in damp cellars at night; they would
not toil in unwholesome employments
from sun-rise till sun-set, whole days, and
whole days and quarters, for with twelve
hours labour the avidity of trade is not satisfied;
they would not sweat night and
day, keeping up this <i>laus perennis</i><span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_7" id="Ref_7" href="#Foot_7">[7]</a></span> of the
Devil, before furnaces which are never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
suffered to cool, and breathing in vapours
which inevitably produce disease and
death; the poor would never do these
things unless they were miserably poor,
unless they were in that state of abject poverty
which precludes instruction, and, by
destroying all hope for the future, reduces
man, like the brutes, to seek for nothing
beyond the gratification of present wants.</p>

<p>How England can remedy this evil, for
there are not wanting in England those
who perceive and confess it to be an evil,
it is not easy to discover, nor is it my
business to enquire. To us it is of more
consequence to know how other countries
may avoid it, and, as it is the prevailing
system to encourage manufactures every
where, to enquire how we may reap as
much good and as little evil as possible.
The best methods appear to be by extending
to the utmost the use of machinery,
and leaving the price of labour to find its
own level: the higher it is the better.
The introduction of machinery in an old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
manufacturing country always produces
distress by throwing workmen out of employ,
and is seldom effected without riots
and executions. Where new fabrics are
to be erected it is obvious that this difficulty
does not exist, and equally obvious
that, when hard labour can be performed
by iron and wood, it is desirable to spare
flesh and blood. High wages are a general
benefit, because money thus distributed
is employed to the greatest general advantage.
The labourer, lifted up one step in
society, acquires the pride and the wants,
the habits and the feelings, of the class
now next above him.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_8" id="Ref_8" href="#Foot_8">[8]</a></span> Forethought,
which the miserably poor necessarily and
instinctively shun, is, to him who earns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
a comfortable competence, new pleasure;
he educates his children, in the hope that
they may rise higher than himself, and
that he is fitting them for better fortunes.
Prosperity is said to be more dangerous
than adversity to human virtue; both are
wholesome when sparingly distributed,
both in the excess perilous always, and
often deadly: but if prosperity be thus
dangerous, it is a danger which falls to the
lot of few; and it is sufficiently proved by
the vices of those unhappy wretches who
exist in slavery, under whatever form or
in whatever disguise, that hope is as essential
to prudence, and to virtue, as to
happiness.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">A</span> <span class="smc">place</span>
more destitute of all interesting
objects than Manchester it is not easy
to conceive. In size and population it is
the second city in the kingdom, containing
above fourscore thousand inhabitants.
Imagine this multitude crowded together
in narrow streets, the houses all built of
brick and blackened with smoke; frequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
buildings among them as large as convents,
without their antiquity, without their
beauty, without their holiness; where you
hear from within, as you pass along, the
everlasting din of machinery; and where,
when the bell rings, it is to call wretches
to their work instead of their prayers....
Imagine this, and you have the materials
for a picture of Manchester. The most
remarkable thing which I have seen here
is the skin of a snake, fourteen English feet
in length, which was killed in the neighbourhood,
and is preserved in the library
of the collegiate church.</p>

<p>We left it willingly on Monday morning,
and embarked upon the canal in a
stage-boat bound for Chester, a city which
we had been advised by no means to pass
by unseen. This was a new mode of
travelling, and a delightful one it proved.
The shape of the machine resembles the
common representations of Noah's ark,
except that the roof is flatter, so made
for the convenience of passengers. Within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
this floating house are two apartments,
seats in which are hired at different prices,
the parlour and the kitchen. Two horses,
harnessed one before the other, tow it
along at the rate of a league an hour; the
very pace which it is pleasant to keep up
with when walking on the bank. The
canal is just wide enough for two boats to
pass; sometimes we sprung ashore, sometimes
stood or sate upon the roof,—till
to our surprise we were called down to
dinner, and found that as good a meal
had been prepared in the back part of the
boat while we were going on, as would
have been supplied at an inn. We joined
in a wish that the same kind of travelling
were extended every where: no time was
lost; kitchen and cellars travelled with us;
the motion was imperceptible; we could
neither be overturned nor run away with,
if we sunk there was not depth of water to
drown us; we could read as conveniently
as in a house, or sleep as quietly as in a
bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
England is now intersected in every direction
by canals. This is the province in
which they were first tried by the present
duke of Bridgewater, whose fortune has
been amply increased by the success of
his experiment. His engineer Brindley
was a singular character, a man of real genius
for this particular employment, who
thought of nothing but locks and levels,
perforating hills, and floating barges upon
aqueduct bridges over unmanageable
streams. When he had a plan to form he
usually went to bed, and lay there working
it out in his head till the design was
completed. It is recorded of him, that
being asked in the course of an examination
before the House of Commons for
what he supposed rivers were created, he
answered after a pause,—To feed navigable
canals.</p>

<p>Excellent as these canals are, rail-roads
are found to accomplish the same purpose
at less expense. In these the wheels of
the carriage move in grooves upon iron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
bars laid all along the road; where there
is a descent no draught is required, and
the laden waggons as they run down draw
the empty ones up. These roads are always
used in the neighbourhood of coal-mines
and founderies. It has been recommended
by speculative men that they
should be universally introduced, and a
hope held out that at some future time this
will be done, and all carriages drawn along
by the action of steam-engines erected at
proper distances. If this be at present one
of the dreams of philosophy, it is a philosophy
by which trade and manufactures
would be benefited and money saved; and
the dream therefore may probably one day
be accomplished.</p>

<p>The canal not extending to Chester, we
were dismissed from the boat about half
way between the two cities, near the town
of Warrington, which was just distant
enough to form a pleasing object through
the intervening trees. A stage, to which
we were consigned, was ready to receive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
us; and we exchanged, not very willingly,
the silent and imperceptible motion of a
water journey, to be jolted over rough
roads in a crowded and noisy coach. The
country was little interesting, and became
less so as we advanced. I saw two bodies
swinging from a gibbet by the road side;
they had robbed and murdered a post-boy,
and, according to the barbarous and indecent
custom of England, were hanged up
upon the spot till their bones should fall
asunder.</p>

<p>We found Chester to be as remarkable
a place as our travelling friend at Manchester
had represented it. The streets
are cut out of a soft red rock, and passengers
walk, not upon flag-stones at the
side, as in most other cities, nor in the
middle of the street,—but through the
houses, upon a boarded parade, through
what would elsewhere be the front room
of the first floor. Whenever a lane or
street strikes off, there is a flight of steps
into the carriage road. The best shops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
are upon this covered way, though there
are others underneath it on a level with
the street. The cathedral is a mean edifice
of soft, red, crumbly stone, apparently
quarried upon the spot: it would have
been folly to have erected any thing better
with such wretched materials.</p>

<p>The old walls are yet standing; there is
a walk on the top of them, from whence
we overlooked the surrounding country,
the mountains of Wales not far distant,
and the river Dee, which passes by the
city, and forms an estuary about two
leagues below it. The new jail is considered
as a perfect model of prison architecture,
a branch of the art as much studied
by the English of the present day, as
ever cathedral building was by their pious
ancestors. The main objects attended to
are, that the prisoners be kept apart from
each other, and that the cells should be
always open to inspection, and well ventilated,
so as to prevent infectious disorders,
which were commonly occurring in old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
prisons. The structure of this particular
prison is singularly curious, the cells being
so constructed that the jailor from his
dwelling-house can look into every one,—a
counterpart to the whispering dungeons
in Sicily, which would have delighted Dionysius.
I thought of Asmodeus and Don
Cleofas. The apartment from whence
we were shown the interior of the prison
was well, and even elegantly furnished;
there were geraniums flowering upon
stands,—a piano-forte, and music-books
lying open,—and when we looked from
the window we saw criminals with irons
upon their legs, in solitary dungeons:—one
of them, who was intently reading
some devotional book, was, we were told,
certainly to be executed at the next assizes.
Custom soon cauterizes human sympathy;
or the situation of the keeper who
sits surrounded with comforts, and has
these things always in view, would be well
nigh as deplorable as that of the wretches
under his care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
Of late years the office of jailor has become
of considerable importance, and ennobled
by the title of Governor. The increase
of criminals has given it this consequence;
and that the number of criminals
must be prodigiously increased, is
sufficiently proved by the frequency and
magnitude of these new prisons. In fact,
more persons annually suffer death in this
country than in the whole of Christendom
besides; and from hence it has been inferred,
that either the people of England
are the most depraved people in Europe,
or their laws are the bloodiest. No, say
the English; the true reason is, that in
other countries crimes are committed with
impunity,—and they never fail to instance
assassination: thus they satisfy themselves
and silence the objector. True it is
that in all the southern parts of Europe,
to our shame be it spoken, assassination is
far more frequently committed than punished;
but murder with us, generally
speaking, is neither in its motive nor in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
manner, the same atrocious crime which
in England is regarded with such religious
abhorrence, and punished with such certain
severity. Among us, a love dispute
between peasants or mechanics leads as
regularly to this deadly spirit of revenge,
as a quarrel upon the point of honour between
two English gentlemen. The Spanish
zagal holds the life of his rival no
cheaper than the English gentleman that
of his equal, who has elbowed him in the
street, or intruded into his places at the
theatre; a blow with us is revenged by the
knife, as it is in England with the pistol.
The difference is, that the sense of honour
extends lower in society among us, and
that the impunity which we allow to all, is
restricted in England to the higher orders;
and the truth is, that, wherever assassination
or duelling prevails, the fault is more
to be imputed to the laws than to the people.
These are offences from which men
may be easily deterred; life will never be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
held cheap by the people, if the laws teach
them that it should be held sacred.</p>

<p>Every stage of society has its characteristic
crimes. The savage is hard-hearted
to his children, brutal to his women,
treacherous to his enemies; he steals and
runs away with his booty; he poisons his
weapons; he is cowardly and cruel. In
the barbarian, pride and courage introduce
a sense of honour which lays the foundation
for morality: he is a robber, not a
thief, ferocious instead of cunning, rather
merciless than cruel. When states become
settled, new offences spring up, as the
weeds in meadow land differ from those of
the waste; laws are necessary to restrain
the strong from oppression, and the weak
from revenge. A new tribe of evils accompany
civilization and commerce,—the
vices which are fostered by wealth, and the
crimes which are produced by want. Still
the progress of the human race, though
slow, is sure; the laws and the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
soften alike, and crimes and punishments
both become less atrocious.</p>

<p>More offences are committed in England
than in other countries, because there is
more wealth and more want; greater temptations
to provoke the poor, greater poverty
to render them liable to temptation,
and less religious instruction to arm them
against it. In Scotland, where the puritan
clergy retain something of their primitive
zeal, the people are more moral; poverty
is almost general there, and therefore the
less felt, because there is little wealth to
invite the contrast. In both countries the
greater number of offences are frauds;
even they who prey upon society partake
of its amelioration, and forsake the barbarous
habits of robbery and murder, for
methods less perilous to themselves and to
others. The weasel fares better than the
wolf, and continues her secret depredations
after the wolf has been extirpated. In
Ireland, on the contrary, where the characteristics
of savage life are still to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
found, murder is the most frequent crime;
and, horrid as it is, it is generally rendered
still more so by circumstances of wanton
cruelty. If the Welsh are addicted to any
peculiar offence it is sheep-stealing, because
the sheep have ceased to be wild,—and
the people have not.</p>

<p>The laws are mitigated in due proportion
to the amelioration of the people:—it was
formerly the custom, if a prisoner refused
to plead to a capital charge, to stretch him
upon his back, and lay weights upon his
breast, which were daily to be increased
till he died; now he is regarded as guilty,
and sentenced as such. Till lately, women
were burnt when men were only hanged;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span>
the punishment is now the same for both
sexes; the horrible butchery for treason,
by which the martyrs suffered under the
persecutions of Elizabeth and James, is
commuted for beheading. In these last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
instances the mitigation is of the national
manners, and not of the law: but
the laws themselves should be amended;
custom is no security: a cruel minister
might enforce these inhuman sentences
which are still pronounced,—and nations
can never take too many precautions
against the possibility of being rebarbarized.
There is no <i>Misericordia</i> in England:
and, except indeed for spiritual assistance,
its humane services are not needed;
the prisoners are sufficiently fed and
clothed, and the law which punishes, allows
every alleviation of punishment which
does not defeat the main end of justice.
Something of the spirit of this charitable
institution was displayed by an individual
in the metropolis two centuries ago. He
gave fifty pounds to the parish in which
the great prison is situated, on condition
that, for ever after, a man on the night
preceding an execution should go to Newgate
in the dead of the night, and strike
with a hand-bell twelve tolls with double
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
strokes, as near the cells of the condemned
criminals as possible,—then exhort them
to repentance. The great bell of the church
was also to toll when they were passing by
on their way to execution, and the bellman
was to look over the wall and exhort
all good people to pray to God for the poor
sinners who were going to suffer death.
Robert Dew was the name of this pious
man: the church is dedicated to the Holy
Sepulchre, which these heretics have ingeniously
converted into a saint!</p>

<p>I need not tell you that the torture has
long since been abolished in England. In
no other part of the world are laws so well
executed; crimes are never committed
here with impunity;—there is no respect
of persons, justice is never defeated by delay,
and the people are not familiarised to
cruelty by the sight of cruel punishments.
The effect of so familiarizing a nation has
been dreadfully exemplified in France. All
history does not present a spectacle more
inexpiably disgraceful to the country in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
which it occurred, than the council of surgeons
assembled to fix the sentence of
Damiens; a council appointed by the king
of France and his ministers, to discover in
what manner the poor madman could be
made to feel the most exquisite tortures,
and kept alive as long as possible to endure
them! Louis XV. signed this sentence,—and
then desired he might not be told
when it was to be executed,—because it
would hurt his feelings! The present king
of England has, in like manner, twice escaped
death; and in both instances the
unhappy persons concerned have been
lodged in the public hospital for the insane.
Is there upon record another contrast
so striking between two neighbouring
nations?</p>

<p>Even however in England some improvements
are still desirable in criminal law.
The principle of the law is, that every man
shall be presumed innocent till he is proved
guilty; yet this principle is never carried
into effect, and the accused are confined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
in irons:—it is necessary to secure
them; but any rigour not absolutely necessary
for this purpose, is in manifest violation
of this humane and just axiom. A
pleader should be permitted to defend the
prisoner, as well as one to accuse him;
where the innocence of the prisoner is
proved, he ought to be indemnified for
the losses he has sustained, and the expenses
he has incurred by his imprisonment
and trial; where he is convicted,
the expense of bringing him to justice
ought to fall upon the public, not upon
the individual prosecutor, already a sufferer
by the offence.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">W</span><span class="smc">e</span>
left Chester yesterday at noon, and
embarked again upon a canal. Our last
navigation had ended by transferring us to
a coach; we had now to undergo a more
unpleasant transfer. The canal reached
the Mersey, a huge river which forms the
port of Liverpool, across which we had
about three leagues to sail in a slant direction.
A vessel was ready to receive us,
on board of which we embarked, and set
sail with a slack wind. At first it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
pleasant sailing,—the day fair, a castellated
hill in full view up the river, and Liverpool
at a distance, near to its mouth, upon
the northern shore. But the wind rose,
the water became rough, there came on
a gale from the west with heavy rain,
which drove us below deck, and then we
were driven up again by the stench of a
close cabin, and the sickness of women
and children. The gale was so strong
that we had reason to be thankful for
reaching the town in safety.</p>

<p>Immediately upon our landing we were
surrounded by boys proffering cards of the
different inns by which they were employed
to look out for strangers, and contesting
who should carry our luggage. The
rain continued, and confined us for the
evening. They have a filthy custom at
the inns in England, that when you pull off
your boots, the man brings you a pair of old
slippers, which serve for all travellers, and
indeed are frequently worn-out shoes with
the heels cut away: clean as the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
are, this impropriety does not in the
slightest degree offend them.</p>

<p>The next morning we enquired for a
gentleman with whom I had been acquainted
in London. A book containing
the names and place of abode of all the
inhabitants is kept in every inn: so that
there was no difficulty in finding him out.
With him we spent the day, and were obliged
to him for showing us whatever was
most worthy of notice in the town. There
is no cathedral, no castle, gate, town-wall,
or monument of antiquity, no marks of decay.
Every thing is the work of late years,
almost of the present generation.</p>

<p>There is but one fine street in the city,
which is terminated by the Exchange, a
handsome structure; but as you look up
the street to it, it is not in the centre, and
this irregularity produces a singularly unpleasant
effect. One side of the street,
it seems, was built with reference to this
Exchange, and the other was to have corresponded
with it; but when the governors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
of the city came to purchase the ground,
some obstacles were discovered which had
not been foreseen. As there are few fine
streets, so there are few which display much
poverty: this external appearance of prosperity
is purchased at a dear price; for the
poor, as in Manchester, live mostly in cellars,
underground. The height of some of
the warehouses excited the wonder of my
companion, and he expressed his surprise
that I should not be astonished at them also.
In fact, old houses in England are generally
lower than modern ones, and even these
have never more than four floors. Yet the
value of ground is prodigiously great, and
the island is not subject to earthquakes.</p>

<p>Here is a hospital for horses, of which
the sign-board caught my eye as we passed
along. We visited a school for the blind,
a sight as interesting as it was melancholy.
They make curtain lines by a machine
which a blind man contrived; list-slippers,
which were an invention of the French
emigrants; baskets;—every thing, in short,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
in which the sense of sight can be supplied
by touch. It was surprising to see them
move about the room, steering clear of
every thing as surely as though they had
seen what was before them,—as if they had
possessed that sixth sense, which experimental
naturalists, the most merciless of
human beings, are said to have discovered
in bats, when they have put out their eyes
for the sake of seeing how the tortured animal
can find its way without them. They
sung a hymn for our gratification: their
voices were fine; and the deep attention
which was manifest in their eyeless faces,
dead as they necessarily were to all external
objects which could distract them, was
affecting and even awful. Such as discover
a taste for music are instructed in
it; and some have been thus enabled
to support themselves as organists in the
churches, and by tuning instruments. The
blind must be very numerous in England,
as I am told there are many such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
institutions; but there is good reason to
hope that the number will be materially
lessened in future by the vaccine inoculation,
a very large proportion of these poor
sufferers having lost their eyes by the smallpox.</p>

<p>Liverpool has become a place of great
maritime trade, against every natural disadvantage.
The river is sheltered only from
the north, and at low-water sand-banks
may be seen round its mouth for leagues
off in every direction. Vessels when leaving
port easily avoid them, because they
start with a fair wind, but to returning
ships they are far more perilous. In spite
of this, there is not any other place where
so much mercantile enterprise is displayed
in England, nor perhaps in the
whole world.—Two ships came in while
we were upon the quay: it was a beautiful
sight to see them enter the docks and take
their quiet station, a crowd flocking towards
them, some in curiosity to know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
what they were, others in hope and in
fear, hastening to see who had returned
in them.</p>

<p>Fortunes are made here with a rapidity
unexampled in any other part of England.
It is true that many adventurers fail; yet
with all the ups and downs of commercial
speculation, Liverpool prospers beyond all
other ports. There is too a princely liberality
in its merchants, which, even in
London, is not rivalled. Let any thing be
proposed for the advantage and ornament,
or honour of the town, however little akin
it may be to their own pursuits, habits, and
feelings, they are ready with subscriptions
to any amount. It has lately been resolved
upon to have a botanical garden here;
a large sum has been raised for the purpose,
and the ground purchased. "It will
be long," said I to our friend, "before
this can be brought to any perfection."
"Oh, sir," said he, with a smile of triumph
which it was delightful to perceive,
"you do not know how we do things
at Liverpool. Money and activity work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
wonders. In half a dozen years we shall
have the finest in England."</p>

<p>The history of their Athenæum is a
striking instance of their spirit:—by this
name they call a public library, with a
reading-room for the newspapers and other
journals,—for all periodical publications,
whether daily, monthly, quarterly, or yearly,
are called <i>journals</i> in England. Two of
the literary inhabitants were talking one
day after dinner of the want of a public
library in the town, and they agreed to call
a meeting for the purpose of forming one.
The meeting was advertised,—they went to
it,—and found themselves alone. "What
shall we do now?" said the one: "here
is an end of the business." "No," said
his friend;—"take you the chair, I will be
secretary; we will draw up our resolutions
unanimously, and advertise them." They
did so; and in four-and-twenty-hours sufficient
funds were subscribed to establish
the finest institution of the kind in the
kingdom.</p>

<p>Literature also flourishes as fairly as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
commerce. A history of Lorenzo de Medici
appeared here about eight years ago,
which even the Italians have thought worthy
of translation. The libraries of Florence
were searched for materials for this
work, and many writings of Lorenzo himself
first given to the world in Liverpool.
This work of Mr Roscoe's has diffused a
general taste for the literature of Italy. It
has been said of men of letters, that, like
prophets, they have no honour in their own
country; but to this saying, to which there
are so few exceptions, one honourable one
is to be found here. The people of Liverpool
are proud of their townsman: whether
they read his book or not, they are
sensible it has reflected honour upon their
town in the eyes of England and of Europe,
and they have a love and jealousy of its
honour, which has seldom been found any
where except in those cities where that
love was nationality, because the city and
the state were the same. This high and
just estimation of Mr Roscoe is the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
praiseworthy, because he is known to be
an enemy to the slave-trade, the peculiar
disgrace of Liverpool.</p>

<p>We had choice of stage-coaches to Kendal,
but it was only a choice between two
of the same sort, the long, coffin-shaped
machines, of which we had had so bad a
sample between Worcester and Birmingham.
One of these we ascended at seven
this morning for a day's journey of twenty
leagues. The outskirts of Liverpool have
an unsightly appearance,—new streets of
houses for the poorer classes, which bear
no marks either of cleanliness or comfort,
fields cut up for the foundations of
other buildings, brick yards, and kilns
smoking on every side. It was not easy
to say where the town ended; for the
paved way, which in all other parts of
England ends with the town, continued
here the whole stage, sorely to our annoyance.
We passed through Ormskirk, a town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
chiefly famous for the preparation of a nostrum
of more repute than efficacy against
hydrophobia, and breakfasted a stage beyond
it, at a single inn beside a bridge, the
worst and dirtiest house of entertainment
which I have yet seen in England. Sometimes
we had a view of the sea towards Ireland;
but the country was flat and unpleasant,
and the trees all blighted and stunted
in their growth; they seemed to have
shrunk and twisted themselves to avoid the
severity of the sea-blasts.</p>

<p>Preston was the next stage, a large manufacturing
town: before we entered it we
crossed the river Ribble by a good bridge,
and immediately ascended a long hill,—it
was the only pleasant spot which we had
seen upon the way. Near this place an officer
once met his death in battle by a singular
accident. His horse upon some disgust he
took at the guns, as the old writer oddly
expresses it, ran off and leapt a ditch; the
man's sword fell, and at the same minute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
he was thrown upon its point, and it ran
him through. There is a spring about
three leagues from hence, the water of
which will burn with a blue flame like spirits
of wine. Beyond Preston the roads were
good, and the country also improved. We
changed horses again at Garstang, a little
town where the picture over the inn door
caught my notice. It was an eagle carrying
away a child—representing a circumstance
which is believed to have happened in old
times in this part of the country. Near
the town we saw the ruins of a castle to
the right. Another easy stage brought us
to Lancaster, one of the best built cities in
the kingdom. The view as we left it after
dinner was truly fine; two stone bridges
over the river Lon, the town on the opposite
bank, and on the highest part of the
hill a castle, which has been newly built
or repaired as a prison.—Lancaster could
scarcely have appeared more beautiful in
the days of the shield and the lance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
Our land of promise was now in sight;
high mountains seen across a great bay,
with all the aërial hues of distance: but
the clouds gathered, and we were driven to
take shelter in the coach from a heavy rain.
About ten we arrived at Kendal. Here,
while supper was preparing, we sent for A
Guide to the Lakes, and a map of them.
This is one of the comforts of travelling in
England;—wherever you go, printed information
is to be found concerning every
thing which deserves a stranger's notice.
From hence our pedestrian expedition was
to begin. We took out our knapsacks,
stored them with a change of linen, &amp;c.,
and dispatched our trunks by the carrier
to meet us at Ambleside.</p>

<p>They produced at supper potted char,
which is their delicacy, this fish being peculiar
to the Lakes. So many are potted
and sent to other parts of the country,
chiefly as presents, that pots are made on
purpose, which have on them a rude representation
of the fish. It resembles a trout,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
but is I am told more beautifully spotted,
and of a more delicate flavour. In its
potted state it was very good, as I suppose
any eatable fish would have been if prepared
in the same manner.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">K</span><span class="smc">endal</span>,
though less populous and less
busy than the noisy manufacturing towns
which we have left behind us, is yet a
place of thriving industry, and has been so
during some centuries. The most interesting
fact connected with its history
is this; after the death of Henry VIII. his
daughter, the pious Mary, being deeply
concerned for the state of his unhappy
soul, would fain have set apart the revenues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
of this parochial church as a fund
for masses in his behalf. She consulted
proper persons upon this matter, who assured
her that the pope would never consent
to it; and she then, still endeavouring
to hope that he was not utterly out of the
reach of intercession, gave the advowson
to a college which he had founded in
Cambridge, thinking that, as the foundation
of this college was the best thing he
had done for himself, the best thing she
could do for him would be to augment its
revenues for his sake.</p>

<p>The morning threatened rain, luckily,
as it induced us to provide ourselves with
umbrellas, a precaution which we might
otherwise have neglected. They make
these things in England to serve also as
walking-sticks, by which means they are
admirably adapted for foot travellers.
Much rain has fallen lately in this neighbourhood;
and the influx of such visitors
as ourselves is so great, that the person of
whom we purchased these umbrellas told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
us, he had sold forty in the course of the
week.</p>

<p>After breakfast we began our march.
You would have smiled to see me with the
knapsack buckled over my breast, and a
staff in hand, which, if not so picturesque
as the pilgrim's, is certainly more convenient
in so showery a land as this. Our
way was up and down steep hills, by a
good road. The carts of this country are
drawn by a single horse; and this is conceived
to be so much the best mode of
draught, that the Board of Agriculture is
endeavouring to make it general throughout
the kingdom. In about two hours we
came in sight of Winandermere, <i>mere</i>
being another word for lake. We had
now travelled over two leagues of uninteresting
ground, where the hills were so
high as to excite expectation of something
to be seen from the summit which we
were toiling up, and when we had reached
the summit, not high enough to realize
the expectation they had excited. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
morning had been over-cast; twice we
had been obliged to our portable penthouses
for saving us from a wetting; the
sun had oftentimes struggled to show himself,
and as often was overclouded again
after ineffectual gleams: but now, when
we had reached the height from which our
promised land was indeed visible, the
weather ceased to be doubtful, the sun
came fairly forth, the clouds dispersed, and
we sat down upon a little rock by the road
side to overlook the scene, perhaps with
greater pleasure, because we had at one
time so little hope of beholding it in such
perfection.</p>

<p>The lake which lay below us is about
three leagues in length: but a long narrow
island stretches athwart it in the middle,
and divides it into two parts. The
lower half resembles a broad river, contracting
its breadth towards the extremity
of the view, where the hills on both sides
seem to die away. The upper end is of a
more complicated, but far nobler character.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
Here the lake is considerably wider;
it is studded with many little islands, and
surrounded with mountains, whose varieties
of form and outline it would be hopeless
to attempt describing. They have
not that wavy and ocean-like appearance,
which you have seen round you among
some of our sierras; each has its individual
form and character; and the whole
have a grandeur, an awfulness, to which
till now I had been a stranger. Two or
three boats were gliding with white sails
upon this calm and lovely water. The
large island in the middle is planted with
ornamental trees, and in the midst of it is
a house, for the architecture of which no
other excuse can be offered, than that, being
round, and other houses usually square,
something unusual may be conceived to
suit so singular a situation. We were
eager for a nearer view, and proceeded
cheerfully to Bowness, a little town upon
its shore; and from thence to the end
of a long tongue of land, whence we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
crossed to an inn called the Ferry, on the
opposite bank,—a single house, overshadowed
by some fine sycamore trees, which
grow close to the water-side.</p>

<p>We were directed to a castellated building
above the inn, standing upon a craggy
point, but in a style so foolish, that, if any
thing could mar the beauty of so beautiful
a scene, it would be this ridiculous edifice.
This absurdity is not remembered when
you are within, and the spot is well
chosen for a banqueting-house. The
room was hung with prints, representing
the finest similar landscapes in Great Britain
and other countries, none of the representations
exceeding in beauty the real
prospect before us. The windows were
bordered with coloured glass, by which
you might either throw a yellow sunshine
over the scene, or frost it, or fantastically
tinge it with purple.—Several boats were
anchored off the island; the neighbouring
islets appeared more beautiful than this
inhabited one, because their trees and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
shrubs had not the same trim, plantation-appearance,
and their shores were left with
their natural inequalities and fringe of
weeds, whereas the other was built up like
a mound against the water.</p>

<p>After dinner we landed on the island,
a liberty which is liberally allowed to
strangers: having perambulated its winding
walks, we rowed about among the
other islets, enjoying the delightful scene
till sun-set. Kingdoms, it is said, are never
so happy as during those years when
they furnish nothing for historians to record:
I think of this now, when feeling
how happy I have been to-day, and how
little able I am to describe this happiness.
Had we been robbed on the road, or overtaken
by storms and upset in the lake,
here would have been adventures for a letter:—do
not however suppose that I am
ambitious of affording you entertainment
at any such price.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span></p>

<p class="gap-above2 center x-spaced">*****</p>

<div class="top">
<div class="small right1">Saturday.</div>
</div>

<p>We slept at the Ferry House, and the
next morning recrossed the water, and
proceeded along a road above the lake,
but parallel with it, to the little village of
Ambleside, which is one of the regular
stations on the tour. The upper end of Winandermere
became more majestic as we
advanced, mountains of greater height and
finer forms opened upon us. The borders
of the lake were spotted with what the
English, in opposition to our application
of the word, call <i>villas</i>, for which it would
be difficult to find a term,—single houses
of the gentry, the <i>casarias</i> of the rich,
which distinguish England so much from
other countries, not only in its appearance,
but in the very name of its society. A
stronger contrast cannot well be imagined
than that of a shore thus ornamented, and
the wild mountains beyond;—yet wooded
hills and crags rising one above the other,
harmonized the whole into one accordant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
and lovely scene. Grand and awful I called
these mountains yesterday: they are
so, and yet the feeling which the whole
scene produces is less that of awe than of
delight. The lake and its green shores
seem so made for summer and sunshine
joyousness, that no fitter theatre could be
devised for Venetian pageantry, with the
Bucentaur and all its train of gondolas.
I wished for Cleopatra's galley, or for
the silken-sailed ships of the days of chivalry,
with their blazonry, their crimson
awnings, their serpent-shaped hulks, music
at the prow, and masquers dancing on
the deck.</p>

<p>Several carriages passed us, and when
we reached Ambleside the inn was full,
and they were obliged to lodge us in the
village, so great is the concourse of visitors
to these Lakes. Some of the old houses
here, with their open balconies, resemble
our cottages and posadas; but these vestiges
of former times will not exist much
longer. New houses are building, old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
ones modernized, and marks of the influx
of money to be seen every where.</p>

<p>It was noon when we arrived, for the
distance was not quite two leagues. Two
smaller lakes were to be seen within a
league of Ambleside, called Ryedale and
Grasmere, and two waterfalls on the way.
This was our afternoon's walk, and a more
beautiful one perhaps is not to be found in
the wide world. My own recollections are
so inadequately represented by any form
of words, that it is best to give up the attempt
as hopeless. One of the waterfalls,
however, is of so singular a character that
it may be imagined from description. We
were admitted into a little hut, and then
beheld it from the window of a rude room,
falling under a bridge, into a bason between
rocks which were overhung with
trees. Every thing is upon so small a
scale, that the trick of surprise is not offensive,
and the sort of frame through
which it was seen, not dissuitable to the
picture. On our way back we took shelter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
from a shower in a cottage, where the
mistress was making oaten cakes, the bread
of this province. The dough being laid on
a round board, which was a little hollowed,
she clapped it out with her hands till it
covered the board; then slipt it off upon
a round iron plate of the same size, which
was placed over a wood fire; and when the
cake was crisp on the one side, as it soon
became, being very thin, she turned it.
We tasted of this bread: it was dry, but
not unpleasant. They who are accustomed
to it like it well, and think it nutritious;
but it is said to produce or aggravate cutaneous
diseases.</p>

<p class="gap-above2 center x-spaced">*****</p>

<div class="top">
<div class="small right1">Sunday.</div>
</div>

<p>The English are not quite so mad in
their own country as they are abroad; and
yet follies enough are committed at home
to show that travelling Englishmen are no
unfaithful representatives of their countrymen.
We had as singular an instance of
their characteristic folly this morning as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
could be wished. D. and I were on our
way to visit Coniston Lake, when, as we
were ascending a hill, we saw an open carriage
drawn by two horses coming down:
the body of the carriage was placed upon
the wheels with the back part forwards,
and a gentleman was driving with his back
to the horses, and never looking round.
The hill was steep, and the road winding;
he was going at no very safe pace; and if
the horses had not been more cautious
than their master, we might very probably
have had an opportunity of seeing what
it was in the inside of his head, which supplied
the place of brains. Some wager must
have been the occasion of this prank.</p>

<p>It was but a dreary road to Coniston, of
two leagues,—neither were we well repaid
when we got there by the sight of a lake
extending into a tame country. Had we
approached from the other end it would
not perhaps have disappointed us, but we
came from the mountains at its head, instead
of advancing towards them. Slates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
of remarkable size are used for fences and
in building about this neighbourhood.
They are so high that I saw one row forming
the whole front of a cottage, and in
another place a house-porch was constructed
of four, one on each side, and
two leaning against each other for the roof.
The quarry is among the mountains.</p>

<p>The language of the people here is almost
unintelligible to me; it resembles
Scotch more than English. D. is frequently
at a loss to understand their meaning,
though they seem to have no difficulty
in understanding him.</p>

<p class="gap-above2 center x-spaced">*****</p>

<p>On Monday we left Ambleside, and toiled
up Kirkstone Mountain, perhaps the
longest and most laborious pass in England,
a full league up, though the highest
point of the road is considerably below
the summit of the mountain. Immediately
upon beginning to descend, a striking
scene opened upon us; we were between
two walls of rock, and on the left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
hand a brook, increased by innumerable
streams from the heights on either side,
rolled down a rocky channel. This opening
soon spread into a vale, which continued
to widen before us as we advanced.
Here we saw scattered cottages built of
loose stones and covered with slates, both
roof and sides so rudely built, so tinged
by weather, and clothed with ferns and
mosses, as to blend with the colours of
the natural scenery, almost as if they had
been things of nature themselves, and not
the work of man. They are the rudest
cottages which I have seen in England,
and indicate either great laziness in the
inhabitants, or dismal poverty.</p>

<p>In this rude vale we met a travelling
Jew pedlar, laden with barometers and
thermometers. What an extraordinary
land is this! In a place as wild and savage
as the desert of Batuecas might we
have purchased such weather-glasses, as
certainly it would be hopeless to seek for
in most of the cities in Spain.</p>

<p>The waters which accompanied our descent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
spread themselves into a little lake
in the valley, called Brotherwater; small,
but exquisitely beautiful. I have never
seen a single spot more beautiful or more
rememberable. The mountain behind,—it
is one of the highest in the country,—forms
a cove, in which a single old mansion
stands in a green field among old trees.
The most rigid Jeronymites could not
wish for a place of more total seclusion.
Out of this lake flowed a little river, clear,
rapid, and melodious; we crossed it, and
our path lay along its banks. How often
did I stop and look back, and close my
eyes to open them again, as if repetition
could better impress the landscape upon
remembrance than continuity; the delight
I felt was mingled with sorrow by a sense
of transitoriness;—it was even painful to
behold scenes so beautiful, knowing that
I should never behold them more.</p>

<p>We had started early, to have the day
before us, so that we reached Paterdale to
breakfast; the distance was two leagues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
and a half, enough to raise an appetite
even had it been plain ground,—and the
mountain air had made us almost ravenous.
If the people of the inn had not been prepared
for a succession of numerous visitors,
our hunger might have looked for
supplies in vain: and if many of their
visitors were as hungry as ourselves, they
would breed a famine in the land. No
banquet, no wines could have exhilarated
us more than food. We truly felt the joy
of health and the reward of exercise.</p>

<p>The abundance of water in these vales
is more delightful than can be imagined.
Nothing languishes here for drought. It
is the midst of summer, and the brooks
are full. If the sound of a tank or a water-wheel
is so agreeable, judge what the
voice must be of these living streams,
now breaking round rocks, which, in the
process of ages, they have worn smooth,
now leaping and foaming from crag to
crag, now coursing over a bed of pebbles.
How little do our Valverdes and Valparaisos
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
bear comparison with these vales,
which are kept always green by streams
which never fail!</p>

<p>Here we took boat upon the lake of Ulswater.
The beauties of Winandermere,
highly as they had excited our admiration,
seemed as nothing when we compared
them with this grander country. Higher
mountains rose here immediately from the
Lake, and instead of villas and gardens
there was a forest on the shore. On Winandermere
I had wished for gondolas and
mirth and music;—here I should have felt
that they were incongruous with the scene,
and with the feelings which it awakened.—The
domestic architecture of the English
is however so abominable that it will spoil
whatever can be spoilt. There is a detestable
house here belonging to a gentleman,
who, for his great possessions in the vale,
is called the King of Paterdale. Wherever
it is seen it is as impertinent and offensive as
the old <i>Gracioso</i><span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_10" id="Ref_10" href="#Foot_10">[10]</a></span> in a scene of real passion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span></p>

<p>Ulswater forms three reaches,—each
three miles in length. The whole can
never be seen at one view, nor indeed any
two of the reaches except from their point.
We landed near a singular building, which
serves as a hunting-seat for the duke of
Norfolk, and we were admitted to see a
waterfall in his garden. Nature produces
as endless varieties of scenery with the
elements of wood, water, and rock, as she
does of countenance with the features of
the human face, and it is as hopeless to
delineate by words the real character of
one as of the other. Ara Force is the name
of this waterfall. A chaise passed us as we
were returning to the boat; there were
three picturesque tourists in it, and one of
them was fast asleep in the corner.</p>

<p>The lake and the mountains end together;
a broad and rapid river called the
Emont flows out of it. We landed, and
proceeded a league and quarter through
a cultivated country to Penrith, a town
which, though we should have thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
little of it in any other part of England,
seems here, by comparison, like a metropolis.
The flies have grievously tormented
us upon our walk. I used to complain
of our mosquitos, but they have at least
the modesty to wait for night and darkness;—these
English tormentors attack
man to his face in broad day-light. Certainly
they are of the same species as those
which were chosen to be one of the
plagues of Egypt.</p>

of Skiddaw.</i></p>

<div class="top">
<div class="small right1">Wednesday.</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">F</span><span class="smc">rom</span>
Penrith to Keswick is four leagues
and a half; and as we were told there was
no place where we could breakfast upon
the way, we lay in bed till a later hour
than would otherwise have beseemed pedestrians.
The views were uninteresting
after such scenery as we had lately passed,
yet, as we were returning to the mountainous
country, they improved as we advanced.
Our road lay under one very fine
mountain called Saddleback, and from
every little eminence we beheld before us
in the distance the great boundaries of the
vale of Keswick. At length, after walking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
five hours, we ascended the last hill, and
saw the vale below us with its lake and
town, girt round with mountains even
more varied in their outline, and more
remarkably grouped, than any which we
had left behind. It was beginning to rain;
and to confess the truth, we derived more
satisfaction from the sight of the town
than from the wonders around it. Joyfully
we reached the inn to which our
trunks had been directed from Ambleside,
but our joy was in no slight degree damped
by the unwelcome intelligence that the
house was full. Was there another inn?—that
was full also; the town was crowded
with company: but if we would walk in
they would endeavour to procure us beds.
In a few minutes word was brought us that
they had procured one bed, if we had no
objection to sleep together,—and if we
had, it seemed there was no alternative.
We were assured, for our comfort, that
strangers had sometimes slept in their carriages.
Accordingly we were conducted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
our apartment, which proved to be at the
house of the barber.</p>

<p>The Barber in England is not the important
personage he is in our country;
he meddles with no surgical instruments,
and the few who draw teeth practise exclusively
among the poor, and are considered,
as degrading the profession;—still the
barber is a person of importance every
where. Our host was as attentively civil
as man could be, and partly out of compliment
to him, partly from a fancy to be
shaved in the English fashion, I submitted
my chin to him. Barbers-basons, it
seems, are as obsolete here as helmets, and
Don Quixote must in this country have
found some other pretext for attacking a
poor shaver. Instead of rubbing the soap
upon the face, he used a brush; this mode
of operating is not so cleanly as our own,
but it is more expeditious. We find him
of great use in directing our movements
here. He has been a sailor; was in the
famous action against the Comte de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
Grasse; and after having been in all parts
of the world, returned at last to his native
place, to pass the remainder of his days
in this humbler but more gainful employment.
His wife was as active as himself
in serving us; our trunks were presently
brought up,—the table laid,—dinner
brought from the inn;—and though we
might have wished for a larger apartment,
which was not to serve for bed-room as
well, yet the behaviour of these people
was so unlike that of inn-waiters, and had
so much the appearance of real hospitality,
that the gratification of seeing it was
worth some little inconvenience. The
room is very neat, and bears marks of industrious
frugality;—it has a carpet composed
of shreds of list of different colours,
and over the chimney-piece is the portrait
of one of the admirals under whom our
host had served.</p>

<p>It rained all night, and we were congratulated
upon this, because the waterfall of
Lodore, the most famous in all this country,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
would be in perfection. As soon as we
had breakfasted a boat was ready for us,
and we embarked on the lake, about half
a mile from the town. A taste for the
picturesque, if I may so far flatter myself
as to reason upon it from self-observation,
differs from a taste for the arts in
this remarkable point,—that instead of
making us fastidious, it produces a disposition
to receive delight, and teaches us to
feel more pleasure in discovering beauty,
than connoisseurs enjoy in detecting a
fault. I have sometimes been satiated
with works of art; a collection of pictures
fatigues me, and I have regarded them at
last rather as a task than as a pleasure.
Here, on the contrary, the repetition of
such scenes as these heightens the enjoyment
of them. Every thing grows upon
me. I become daily more and more sensible
of the heights of the mountains,
observe their forms with a more discriminating
eye, and watch with increased
pleasure the wonderful changes they assume
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
under the effect of clouds or of sunshine.</p>

<p>The Lake of Keswick has this decided
advantage over the others which we have
seen, that it immediately appears to be
what it is. Winandermere and Ulswater
might be mistaken for great rivers, nor
indeed can the whole extent of either be
seen at once; here you are on a land-locked
bason of water, a league in length, and
about half as broad,—you do not wish it
to be larger, the mirror is in perfect proportion
to its frame. Skiddaw, the highest
and most famous of the English mountains,
forms its northern boundary, and
seems to rise almost immediately from its
shore, though it is at the nearest point
half a league distant, and the town intervenes.
One long mountain, along which
the road forms a fine terrace, reaches
nearly along the whole of its western
side; and through the space between this
and the next mountain, which in many
points of view appears like the lower segment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
of a prodigious circle, a lovely vale
is seen which runs up among the hills.
But the pride of the Lake of Keswick is
the head, where the mountains of Borrodale
bound the prospect, in a wilder and
grander manner than words can adequately
describe. The cataract of Lodore thunders
down its eastern side through a chasm in
the rocks, which are wooded with birch
and ash trees. It is a little river, flowing
from a small lake upon the mountains
about a league distant. The water, though
there had been heavy rains, was not adequate
to the channel;—indeed it would
require a river of considerable magnitude
to fill it,—yet it is at once the finest work
and instrument of rock and water that I
have ever seen or heard. At a little public-house
near, where the key of the entrance
is kept, they have a cannon to display
the echo; it was discharged for us,
and we heard the sound rolling round from
hill to hill,—but for this we paid four shillings,—which
are very nearly a peso duro.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
So that English echoes appear to be the
most expensive luxuries in which a traveller
can indulge. It is true there was
an inferior one which would have cost
only two shillings and sixpence; but when
one buys an echo, who would be content,
for the sake of saving eighteen pence, to
put up with the second best, instead of
ordering at once the super-extra-double
superfine?</p>

<p>We walked once more at evening to the
Lake side. Immediately opposite the quay
is a little island with a dwelling-house
upon it. A few years ago it was hideously
disfigured with forts and batteries, a sham
church, and a new druidical temple, and,
except a few fir-trees, the whole was bare.
The present owner has done all which a
man of taste could do in removing these
deformities: the church is converted into
a tool-house, the forts demolished, the
batteries dismantled, the stones of the
druidical temple employed in forming a
bank, and the whole island planted. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
is something in this place more like the
scenes of enchantment in the books of
chivalry than like any thing in our ordinary
world,—a building, the exterior of which
promised all the conveniences and elegancies
of life, surrounded with all ornamental
trees, in a little island the whole of
which is one garden, and that in this
lovely lake, girt round on every side with
these awful mountains. Immediately behind
it is the long dark western mountain
called Brandelow: the contrast between
this and the island, which seemed to be the
palace and garden of the Lady of the Lake,
produced the same sort of pleasure that a
tale of enchantment excites, and we beheld
it under circumstances which heightened
its wonders, and gave the scene something
like the unreality of a dream. It was a
bright evening, the sun shining, and a
few white clouds hanging motionless in
the sky. There was not a breath of air
stirring,—not a wave, a ripple, or wrinkle
on the lake, so that it became like a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
mirror, and represented the shores, mountains,
sky, and clouds so vividly, that there
was not the slightest appearance of water.
The great mountain-opening being reversed,
in the shadow became a huge arch,
and through that magnificent portal the
long vale was seen between mountains and
bounded by mountain beyond mountain,
all this in the water, the distance perfect
as in the actual scene,—the single houses
standing far up in the vale, the smoke
from their chimneys,—every thing the
same, the shadow and the substance joining
at their bases, so that it was impossible
to distinguish where the reality ended
and the image began. As we stood on the
shore, heaven and the clouds and the sun
seemed lying under us; we were looking
down into a sky, as heavenly and as beautiful
as that overhead, and the range of
mountains, having one line of summit under
our feet and another above us, were
suspended between two firmaments.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span></p>

<p class="gap-above2 center x-spaced">*****</p>

<div class="top">
<div class="small right1">Thursday.</div>
</div>

<p>This morning we enquired as anxiously
about the weather as if we had been on
shipboard, for the destined business of the
day was to ascend the great Skiddaw. After
suffering hopes and fears, as sunshine
or cloud seemed to predominate, off we
set with a boy to guide us. The foot of
the mountain lies about a mile from the
town; the way for the first stage is along
a green path of gradual and uninterrupted
ascent, on the side of a green declivity.
At the northern end of the vale there is
another lake, called Bassenthwaite, closed
in like a wedge between two mountains,
and bounding the view; the vale, with both
its lakes, opened upon us as we ascended.
The second stage was infinitely more laborious,
being so steep, though still perfectly
safe, that we were many times forced to
halt for breath, and so long that before we
had completed it the first ascent seemed
almost levelled with the vale. Having conquered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
this, the summit appeared before
us, but an intervening plain, about a mile
across, formed the third stage of the journey;
this was easy travelling over turf and moss.
The last part was a ruder ascent over loose
stones with gray moss growing between
them,—on the immediate summit there is
no vegetation. We sat down on a rude
seat formed by a pile of these stones, and
enjoyed a boundless prospect,—that is, one
which extended as far as the reach of the
human eye, but the distance was dim and
indistinct. We saw the sea through a
hazy atmosphere, and the smoke of some
towns upon the coast about six leagues off,
when we were directed where to look for
them: the Scotch mountains appeared beyond
like clouds, and the Isle of Man,
we were told, would have been visible
had the weather been clearer. The home
scene of mountains was more impressive,
and in particular the Lake of Bassenthwaite
lying under a precipice beneath us. They
who visit the summit usually scratch their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
names upon one of the loose stones which
form the back to this rude seat. We felt
how natural and how vain it was to leave
behind us these rude memorials, which so
few could possibly see, and of those few
in all human probability none would recognise,—yet
we followed the example of our
predecessors. There are three such seats
upon the three points of the mountain;
all which we visited. It is oftentimes piercingly
cold here, when the weather is temperate
in the vale. This inconvenience we
did not perceive, for the wind was in the
south,—but it brought on rain as we were
descending, and thoroughly wetted us before
we reached home.</p>

<p>After dinner, as the rain still continued,
and we could not go further from home,
we went to see an exhibition of pictures
of the Lakes, a few doors distant. There
were several views of one called Waswater,
which is so little visited that our
book of directions is silent concerning it.
It seemed to us, however, to be of so striking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
a character, and so different from all
which we have yet seen, that we consulted
with our host concerning the distance and
the best mode of getting there, and have
accordingly planned a route which is to
include it, and which we shall commence
tomorrow.</p>

<p>The people here wear shoes with wooden
soles. D., who had never seen any thing
of the kind before, was inclined to infer
from this that the inhabitants were behind
the rest of England in improvement; till
I asked him whether in a country so subject
to rain as by experience we knew this
to be, a custom which kept the feet dry
ought not to be imputed to experience
of its utility rather than to ignorance;
and if, instead of their following the
fashions of the south of England, the
other peasantry would not do wisely in
imitating them.</p>

Lakes which we were next to explore
lay south-west, and west of Keswick. We
took an early breakfast, provided ourselves
with some hard eggs, slung our knapsacks,
and started about seven, taking the
horse-road to Lodore. The morning promised
well, there was neither sun to heat
us, nor clouds enough to menace rain;
but our old tormentors the flies swarmed
from the hedges and coppices by which
we passed, as many, as active, as impudent,
and hardly less troublesome than the
imps who beset St Anthony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
For half a league we had no other view
than what a gate, a gap in the hedge, or
an occasional rise of ground afforded.
On the left was an insulated hill of considerable
height wooded to the summit,
and when we had left this, a coppice
which reached to the foot of a long and
lofty range of crags, and spread every where
up the acclivity where soil enough could
be found for trees to take root. This covered
road terminated in a noble opening:
from a part which was almost completely
overbowered we came out at once upon a
terrace above the Lake, the open crags
rising immediately upon the left. Among
these rocks some painter formerly discovered
the figure of a female, which, with
the help of imagination, may easily be made
out, and accordingly he named the place
Eve's crag, because, he said, she must certainly
have been the first woman.—Lodore
was glittering before us, not having yet discharged
all the rain of yesterday; and
Borrodale, into which we were bound, became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
more beautiful the nearer we approached.</p>

<p>We had consulted tourists and topographers
in London, that we might not overpass
any thing worthy of notice, and
our Guide to the Lakes was with us.
They told us of tracts of horrible barrenness,
of terrific precipices, rocks rioting
upon rocks, and mountains tost together
in chaotic confusion; of stone avalanches
rendering the ways impassable, the
fear of some travellers who had shrunk
back from this dreadful entrance into
Borrodale, and the heroism of others who
had dared to penetrate into these impenetrable
regions:—into these regions, however,
we found no difficulty in walking
along a good road, which coaches of the
light English make travel every summer's
day. At the head of the lake, where the
river flows into this great reservoir, the
vale is about a mile in width, badly cultured
because badly drained, and often
overflowed; but the marsh lands had now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
their summer green, and every thing was
in its best dress. The vale contracted as
we advanced, and was not half this width
when, a mile on, we came to a little village
called the Grange.</p>

<p>This village consists of not more than
half a score cottages, which stand on a
little rising by the river side,—built apparently
without mortar, and that so long
ago that the stones have the same weather-worn
colour as those which lie upon the
mountain side behind them. A few pines
rise over them, the mountains appear to
meet a little way on and form an amphitheatre,
and where they meet their base is
richly clothed with coppice wood and
young trees. The river, like all the streams
of this country, clear, shallow, and melodious,
washes the stone bank on which
the greater number of the pines grow, and
forms the foreground with an old bridge
of two arches, as rude in construction as
the cottages. The parapet has fallen down,
and the bridge is impassable for carts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
which ford a little way above. The road
from the bridge to the village is in ruins;
it had been made with much labour, but
has been long neglected, and the floods
have left only the larger and deeper rooted
stones, and in other places the floor of
rock; the inhabitants therefore are relatively
poorer than they were in former
times.—In this scene here are all the elements
which the painter requires; nothing
can be more simple than the combination,
nothing more beautiful. I have never in
all my travels seen a spot which I could
recall so vividly; I never remember it
without fancying that it can easily be described,—yet
never attempt to clothe my
recollections in words without feeling how
inadequately words can represent them.</p>

<p>Another mile of broken ground, the
most interesting which I ever traversed,
brought us to a single rock called the
Bowder Stone, a fragment of great size
which has fallen from the heights. The
same person who formerly disfigured the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
island in Keswick Lake with so many abominations,
has been at work here also;
has built a little mock hermitage, set up
a new druidical stone, erected an ugly
house for an old woman to live in who is
to show the rock, for fear travellers should
pass under it without seeing it, cleared
away all the fragments round it, and as
it rests upon a narrow base, like a ship
upon its keel, dug a hole underneath
through which the curious may gratify
themselves by shaking hands with the old
woman. The oddity of this amused us
greatly, provoking as it was to meet with
such hideous buildings in such a place,—for
the place is as beautiful as eyes can
behold, or imagination conceive. The river
flows immediately below, of that pale
gray green transparency which we sometimes
see in the last light of the evening
sky; a shelf of pebbles on the opposite
shore shows where it finds its way through
a double channel when swoln by rains:—the
rest of the shore is covered with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
grove of young trees which reach the foot
of a huge single crag, half clothed with
brush-wood:—this crag when seen from
Keswick appears to block up the pass.
Southward we looked down into Borrodale,
whither we were bound,—a vale which
appeared in the shape of a horse-shoe.</p>

<p>This lovely vale when we had descended
into it, appeared to lie within an amphitheatre
of mountains; but as we advanced
we perceived that its real shape was that of
the letter Y: our way lay along the right
branch. They have a pestilential fungus
in this country which has precisely the
smell of putrid carrion, and is called by
the fit name of the stinker. It is so frequent
as to be quite a nuisance along the
road. We passed through one little village,
and left a second on our right, the loneliest
imaginable places;—both villages, and
the few single houses which we saw in the
vale, have pines planted about them. A
third and still smaller village called Seathwaite
lay before us, drearily situated, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
no attempt has been made to drain
the land around, easily as it might be done.
Above this lies the mine of black-lead of
which those pencils so famous over all
Europe are made,—it is the only one of
the kind which has yet been discovered.
We could not see it, as it is worked only
occasionally, and had just been shut.</p>

<p>Our attention had been too much engaged
by the delightful scenes around us
to let us think of the weather, when, to
our surprise, it began to rain hard:—there
was no alternative but to proceed, for we
were between two and three leagues from
Keswick. Dreary as the wet and plashy
ground about Seathwaite had appeared as
we approached, it became cheerful when
we looked back upon it,—for it seemed as
if we were leaving all inhabitable parts,—nothing
but rock and mountain was to be
seen.—When we had almost reached the
extremity of this ascending vale, we came
to a little bridge, as rude as work of human
hands can be; the stream making a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
little cataract immediately under it. Here
the ascent of the mountain began, a steep,
wet, winding path, more like a goat's highway
than the track of man. It rained
heavily; but we consoled ourselves with
remarking that the rain kept us cool,
whereas we should otherwise have suffered
much from heat. After long labour we
reached a part which from its easier acclivity
seemed almost like a plain; and keeping
by the side of a little stream came to a
small mountain lake, or Tarn as it is called
in the language of the country. A crag
rose behind it; the water was so dark that
till I came close to it I could scarcely
believe it was clear. It may be thought
that there is nothing more in a pool on the
mountains, than in a pool on a plain,—but
the thing itself occasions a totally different
sensation. The sense of loneliness
is an awful feeling. I have better understood
why the saints of old were
wont to retire into the wilderness, since
I have visited these solitudes. The maps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
call this Sparkling Tarn; but Low Tarn is
the name given it in the neighbourhood,
and another about half an hour's height
above it they call High Tarn. This other
is omitted in the maps, which, indeed, the
knowledge we have of their track, little as
it is, enables us to say are very incorrect.
It would make a fine picture, and the
height of its situation might be expressed
by alpine plants in the foreground.</p>

<p>Beyond this there was about half a mile
still up, and by a steeper road. Having
reached the highest point, which is between
Scafell and Great Gabel, two of the highest
mountains in England, we saw Wasdale
below bending to the south-west, between
mountains whose exceeding height
we were now able to estimate by our own
experience,—and to the west the sea appeared
through an opening. The descent
may without exaggeration be called tremendous;
not that there is danger, but
where any road is possible, it is not possible
to conceive a worse. It is, like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
whole surface round it, composed of loose
stones, and the path serpentizes in turns
as short and as frequent as a snake makes
in flight. It is withal as steep as it can
be to be practicable for a horse. At first
we saw no vegetation whatever; after a
while only a beautiful plant, called here
the stone-fern, or mountain parsley, a
lovely plant in any situation, but appearing
greener and lovelier here because it
was alone. The summits every where were
wrapt in clouds; on our right, however, we
could see rocks rising in pinnacles and
grotesque forms,—like the lines which I
have seen a child draw for rocks and mountains,
who had heard of but never seen
them,—or the edge of a thundercloud rent
by a storm. Still more remarkable than
the form is the colouring; the stone is
red; loose heaps or rather sheets of stones
lay upon the sides,—in the dialect of the
country they call such patches <i>screes</i>, and
it is convenient to express them by a single
word: those which the last winter had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
brought down were in all their fresh redness,
others were white with lichens; here
patches and lines of green were interposed.
At this height the white lichen predominated,
but in other parts that species is
the commonest which is called the geographical
from its resemblance to the lines of
a map; it is of a bright green, veined and
spotted with black,—so bright as if nature,
in these the first rudiments of vegetation,
had rivalled the beauty of her choicest
works. Wasdale itself, having few
trees and many lines of enclosure, lay below
us like a map.</p>

<p>The Lake was not visible till we were
in the valley. It runs from north-east
to south-west, and one mountain extends
along the whole of its southern side, rising
not perpendicularly indeed, but so nearly
perpendicular as to afford no path, and
so covered with these loose stones as to
allow of no vegetation, and to be called
from them <i>The Screes</i>. The stream which
accompanied our descent was now swoln
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
into a river by similar mountain torrents
descending from every side. The dale is
better cultivated at the head than Borrodale,
being better drained; and the houses
seemed to indicate more comfort and more
opulence than those on the other side the
mountain; but stone houses and slate roofs
have an imposing appearance of cleanliness
which is not always verified upon near
inspection. Ash trees grow round the
houses, greener than the pine, more graceful,
and perhaps more beautiful,—yet we
liked them less:—was this because, even
in the midst of summer, the knowledge
that the pine will not fade influences us,
though it is not directly remembered?</p>

<p>The rain now ceased, and the clouds grew
thinner. They still concealed the summits,
but now began to adorn the mountain,
so light and silvery did they become.
At length they cleared away from the top,
and we perceived that the mountain whose
jagged and grotesque rocks we had so
much admired was of pyramidal shape.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
That on the southern side of the dale head,
which was of greater magnitude, and therefore
probably, though not apparently, of
equal height, had three summits. The
clouds floated on its side, and seemed to
cling to it. We thought our shore tamer
than the opposite one, till we recollected
that the road would not be visible from
the water; and presently the mountain,
which had appeared of little magnitude or
beauty while we passed under it, became,
on looking back, the most pyramidal of
the whole, and in one point had a cleft
summit like Parnassus; thus forming the
third conical mountain of the group,
which rose as if immediately from the
head of the Lake, the dale being lost.
But of all objects <i>the screes</i> was the most
extraordinary. Imagine the whole side
of a mountain, a league in length, covered
with loose stones, white, red, blue, and
green, in long straight lines as the torrents
had left them, in sheets and in patches,
sometimes broken by large fragments of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
rocks which had unaccountably stopt in
their descent, and by parts which, being
too precipitous for the stones to rest on,
were darkened with mosses,—and every
variety of form and colour was reflected
by the dark water at its foot: no trees or
bushes upon the whole mountain,—all was
bare, but more variegated by this wonderful
mixture of colouring than any vegetation
could have made it.</p>

<p>The Lake is a league in length, and the
hilly country ends with it. We entered
upon a cultivated track, well wooded, and
broken with gentle swells, the mountains
on the right and left receding towards Ennerdale
and Eskdale. About half a league
beyond the end of the Lake we came to a
miserable alehouse, the first which we had
found all day, where they charged us an
unreasonable price for milk and oaten
bread. We went into a church-yard here,
and were surprised at seeing well-designed
and well-lettered tombstones of good
red stone, in a place apparently inhabited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
by none but poor peasantry. In about
another league we came to a larger village,
where manufactures had begotten alehouses;
in the church-yard was a pillar of
the Pagan Danes converted into a cross,
once curiously sculptured, but the figures
are now nearly effaced. Here we came
into the high road which runs along the
coast, and in a short time arrived at a little
town called Calder Bridge, where, to our
comfort, after a walk of not less than seven
leagues, we found a good inn. The bridge
from which this place is named is very beautiful;
the river flows over rocks which it
has furrowed at the banks, so that shelves
of rock jut out over the water, here green,
here amber-coloured; ash, mountain-ash,
and sycamores overhang it.<span class="squash">——</span>We have
seen inscriptions over some of the houses
in Saxon characters to-day,—a proof how
long old customs have been retained in
these parts.</p>

<p>"Well," said D. this morning when he
came into my room, "we shall not be
caught in the rain to-day, that is certain,—for
we must set off in it."—We were to return
to Keswick by way of Ennerdale and
Crummock Lakes:—the road was not easy
for strangers, and we soon lost it; but while
we were stopping to admire an oak growing
from three trunks of equal size which
united into one, breast-high from the
ground, a man overtook us and set us
right. Perhaps the tree was originally
planted upon a hillock, and these three
stems had been the roots. It was nearly
two leagues to Ennerdale bridge, and it
rained heavily the whole way:—there we
breakfasted in a dirty and comfortless alehouse;—but
while we dried ourselves by
the fire the sun came out, and we set off
cheerfully towards the foot of the Lake.</p>

<p>Ennerdale water is a sort of square,
spreading widely at its base. The mountains
seem to have planted their outworks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
in the lake; they rise directly up to a certain
height on both sides, then leave an
interval of apparently level ground, behind
which they start up again to a great height.
All are bare, with something of the same
colouring as in Wasdale, but in a less
degree. The Lake is about a league in
length; at its foot the dale is cultivated,
spotted with such houses as suit the scene;
and so wooded as to form a fitting and delightful
foreground. We had here a singular
and most beautiful effect of shadow.
A line of light crossed the Lake; all that
was in sunshine seemed water; all that was
in shade reflected the shores so perfectly,
with such a motionless and entire resemblance,
that it appeared as if the water
were stopt by some unseen dam on the
edge of a precipice, or abyss, to which no
bottom could be seen.</p>

<p>From this place we ventured to cross
the mountains to Crummock, where there
was no track: they told us we could not
miss the way; and it was true,—but woe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
to the traveller who should be overtaken
there by clouds or by storms! It was a wild
tract,—a few straggling sheep upon the
green hill sides, and kites screaming over head,
the only living things. We saw the
rude outline of a man cut in the turf by
some idle shepherd's boy, and it gave us
some pleasure as being the work of hands.
As we were descending, having effected a
passage of nearly three hours, we saw to
our right a chasm in the mountain in which
trees were growing, and out of which a
stream issued. There we turned, and soon
found that it must needs be the waterfall
called Scale-force, one of the objects especially
marked in our route. The stream
falls down a fissure in the rock in one unbroken
stream, from a prodigious height,
then rolls along a little way, and takes
a second but less leap, before it issues
out.</p>

<p>A heavy shower came on: but we were
well repaid on reaching the shore of Crummock
Lake; for one of the loveliest rainbows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
that ever eyes beheld, reached along
the great mountain opposite,—the colours
of the mountain itself being scarcely less
various or less vivid. We came to an inn
at the foot of the Lake, procured a boat
and embarked; but this Lake is not supplied
like Winandermere and Keswick.
Never did adventurers in search of pleasure
set foot in a more rotten and crazy
embarkation,—it was the ribs and skeleton
of a boat: however, there was no other;
if we would go upon the Lake we must be
contented with this. We were well repaid:—for,
of all the scenes in the Land of
Lakes, that from the middle of Crummock
is assuredly the grandest. In colour the
mountains almost rival the rainbow varieties
of Waswater; they rise immediately
from the water, and appear therefore
higher and more precipitous than any
which we have seen. Honistar crag forms
the termination, the steepest rock in the
whole country, and of the finest form; it
resembles the table-mountains in the East
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
Indies, each of which has its fortress on
the summit. To appearance it was at the
end of this water, but a little vale intervened,
and the smaller Lake of Buttermere.
We landed at the end, and walked to the
village by this second water, where we took
up our abode for the night, for the first time
in a village inn.</p>

<p class="gap-above2 center x-spaced">*****</p>

<div class="top">
<div class="small right1">Sunday.</div>
</div>

<p>The western side of this little lake is formed
by a steep mountain called Red Pike; a
stream runs down it, issuing from a Tarn
in a bason near the summit, which, when
seen from below, or from the opposite
heights, appears certainly to have been once
the crater of a volcano. The situation of
this Tarn was so peculiar that we would
not leave it unseen. Before breakfast we
commenced our labour, and labour in
truth it was. We had supposed an hour
and a half would be sufficient for the expedition;
but we were that time in getting
up, and just as long in returning, so steep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
was the mountain side. As we ascended,
it was remarkable to perceive how totally
Crummock water had lost all its grandeur,—it
was a striking emblem of human
pursuits, thus divested of their importance
and dwindled into insignificance when we
look back upon them. Having conquered
the ascent, instead of finding the Tarn
immediately on the edge, as we expected,
there was a plain of half a mile to cross,
and then we found it lying under a buttress
of rock,—as lonely a spot as ever mountain
kite sailed over. Like Low Tarn, its waters
were dark; but the sun shone, and the
wind just breaking up the surface, rolled
over it a fleeting hue like the colour of a
pigeon's neck. There is a pleasure in
seeing what few besides ourselves have
seen. One Tarn, I perceive, differs little
from another:—but the slighter the difference
of features is, the more pleasure there
is in discovering that difference;—and if
another of these mountain pools lay in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
our way, I should willingly spend three
hours more in ascending to it.</p>

<p>The most unpleasant part of this expedition,
fatiguingly steep as it was,—and
nothing could be steeper which was not
an actual precipice,—was, that we had a
wall to cross of loose stones, very broad,
and as high as an ordinary man's stature.
The utmost care was necessary, lest we
should drag the stones after us; in which
case they would have killed us and buried
us at the same time.</p>

<p>Our road to Keswick lay up a long ascent
between green swelling mountains—a
pastoral scene, with its stream in the
bottom, and sheep-folds beside it—then
down that vale of Newlands, which is seen
so beautifully from Keswick through the
great mountain portal.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">W</span><span class="smc">e</span>
were now to leave the land of lakes
and turn our faces towards London. T  he
regular road would have been to have returned
to Penrith, and there have met the
stage; but it would cost us only half a day's
journey to visit Carlisle from whence it
starts; and a city whose name occurs so
often in English history, being the frontier
town on this part of the Scotish border,
was deserving of this little deviation
from the shortest route. For Carlisle,
therefore, we took chaise from Keswick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
the distance being eight leagues. Our
road lay under Skiddaw, and, when we
had advanced about five miles, overlooked
the lake of Bassenthwaite, nearly the
whole of its length. We now perceived
the beauty of this water, which, because
of its vicinity to Keswick, is contemptuously
overlooked by travellers; and the
sight of its wooded shores, its mountainous
sides, with its creeks and bays, and
the grand termination formed by the Borrodale
mountains as we looked back, made
us regret that we had not devoted a day
to exploring it. The road at length bent
to the eastward, leaving the lake; and
shortly afterwards, walking up a steep
hill, we had a new and striking view of
the vale. The Lake of Keswick was hidden
behind Brandelow, the long mountain
which forms its western bank: over
this appeared the mountains behind the
waterfall of Lodore, and over these we
could distinguish the point of a remarkable
mountain at the head of Winandermere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
This was our last view of this
lovely country: and a certainty that it
was the last, that no circumstances could
ever lead me to it again, made me gaze
longer and more earnestly, as if to fix
deeper in my memory so exquisite a landscape.
I remembered the day of my departure
from my father's house, and, for
the first time, anticipated with fear the
time when I should leave England, never
to return to it.</p>

<p>We had left the mountains, but their
roots or outworks extended to some distance
before the plain began. The road
lay over an open country of broken ground,
with hills at a little distance, enclosed in
square patches, and newly, as it appeared,
brought into cultivation. There was not a
single tree rising in the hedge-rows. Our
stage was to Wigton, five leagues and a
half, which is unusually far. The postboy
rested his horses at Ireby, one of
those townlets in which every thing reminds
us of the distance from a metropolis.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
It consists of a few houses forming
something like a plaza, grass grows between
the stones of the pavement, and
the children came clattering round us in
their wooden shoes, as if the sight of a
chaise were a novelty. We soon gained
an eminence, from whence the flat country
opened upon us. Solway Firth and
the Scotish mountains lay to the north,
to the east and south the plain extended
as far as we could see;—a noble prospect,
and to us the more striking as we had
been so much among the close scenery of
a mountainous district. We passed near
a quadrangular farm-house, which the
driver told us was built like those in Scotland.
The dwelling and out-houses are
round the fold, and the dung-hill in the
middle of the court. This form was evidently
devised for defence against cow-stealers.</p>

<p>Wigton bears all the marks of increasing
prosperity. It is not many years
since its market was held on Sunday,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
and the country people bought their meat
before they went into church, carried it
into the church with them, and hung it
over the back of their seats till the service
was over. The many well-drest inhabitants
whom we beheld were sufficient
proof that no such custom could now be
tolerated there. Good inns, good shops,
carts and chaises in the streets, and masons
at work upon new houses, were symptoms
of rapid improvement. They paint
their houses with a dark red, thus hiding
and disfiguring good stone; perhaps it
may be thought the paint preserves the
stone, but there can be no good reason
for preferring so abominable a colour.
Going up the stairs of the inn I noticed a
common alehouse print of the battle of
Wexford, which was an action with the
Irish insurgents, in the late rebellion in
that country. It represented a lady, by
name Miss Redmond, at the head of the
rebels, who is said to have taken arms to
revenge the death of her lover. The artist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
was probably a well-wisher to the Irishmen.</p>

<p>From hence to Carlisle was less than
three leagues, and the cathedral was in
view over the plain. We met carts upon
the way having wheels of primitive rudeness,
without spokes, such as are used in
our country, and which I have never till
now seen since I left it. One of these
wheels we saw by the road side, laid
against the bank as a stile, its two holes
serving as ladder-steps to ascend by. Carlisle
is the capital of these parts, and is
indeed a great city. While dinner was
preparing we hastened to the cathedral.
Its tower would not be thought fine upon
a parochial English church, and looks the
worse for standing upon so large a body.
The inside, however, proved far more interesting
than the exterior had promised.
The old stalls remain, admirably carved
in English oak, which rivals stone in
durability; but the choir is disfigured
by a double row of those vile partitions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
which crowd and debase all the heretical
churches; and the window, instead of old
painted glass, of which every pane is stained,
having only a border of bright yellow,
with corners of bright green, round
uncoloured compartments, flings a glaring
and ill-assorted light. The lives of St Augustine, St Anthony the Great,
and St Cuthbert, are represented here in a series
of pictures. They were plaistered over at
the time of the schism, but have been
lately recovered as much as possible, by
the exertions of Percy, the antiquary and
poet, who is a dignitary of this church.
As vestiges of antiquity they are curious;
but otherwise they might well have been
spared, the subjects being taken from
those fabulous legends by which men of
mistaken piety have given so much occasion
of scandal. One of them represents
the devil appearing to St Augustine, with
a large book upon his back, fastened with
great clasps, which is the register wherein
he keeps his account of sins committed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
and it seems a sufficient load for him. He
had brought it to show the Saint his
debtor account, which we are to suppose
has been cancelled by immediate prayer,
for the devil is saying, <i>Pœnitet me tibi ostendisse
librum</i>, 'I repent having shown
thee the book.' Over some of the oldest
tombs we noticed a remarkable form of
arch, which might be adduced as an example
of the sylvan origin of Gothic architecture:
it resembles a bent bough, of
which the branches have been lopt, but
not close to the stem.</p>

<p>The city walls, which half a century
ago were capable of defence, are now in a
state of decay; the castle is still guarded,
because within the court there is a depositary
of arms and field-pieces. Here is
an entire portcullis, formed of wood cased
with iron. Manufactories of late introduction
have doubled the population within
few years, but with little addition to
the decent society of the place. Poor
Scotch and poor Irish chiefly make up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
the increase, and the city swarms with
manufacturing poor in their usual state of
depravity. We are once more in the land
of salmon. Some of the natives here take
this fish with a dexterity truly savage;
they ride on horseback into the water, and
pierce them with a heavy trident as long
as a tilting-spear.</p>

<p>I observe many peculiarities at our inn.
Two grenadiers painted upon wood, and
then cut out to the picture so as to resemble
life, keep guard, one at the bottom
of the stairs, another half way up. They
brought us a singular kind of spoon in our
negus,—longer than the common one,
the stem round, twisted in the middle,
and ending in a heavy button or head,
the heavy end being placed in the glass,
and designed to crush the sugar. The boot-cleaner
is an old Scotchman, with all the
proverbial civility of his nation;—he entered
with a low bow, and asked if we
would <i>please to give him leave</i> to clean our
boots. My bed curtains may serve as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
good specimen of the political freedom
permitted in England. General Washington
is there represented driving American
Independence in a car drawn by leopards,
a black Triton running beside them, and
blowing his conch,—meant, I conceive, by
his crown of feathers, to designate the native
Indians. In another compartment,
Liberty and Dr Franklin are walking hand
in hand to the Temple of Fame, where two
little cupids display a globe, on which
America and the Atlantic are marked.
The tree of liberty stands by, and the
stamp-act reversed is bound round it. I
have often remarked the taste of the people
for these coarse allegories.</p>

<p>At six we were on the roof of the stage-coach
on our return to London after
this long journey. We saw symptoms of
our vicinity to Scotland upon the road.
Scotch drovers were on their way home,
men who are employed in driving lean cattle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
into England to be fattened for the
English market; they wore instead of a
hat a sort of flat turban, and had a large
mantle of gray checquered cloth scarft
round them, a costume far more graceful
than the English. One woman we saw
walking barefoot, and carrying her shoes
in her hand.—"'Tis the way they do in
Scotland," said the coachman, who seemed
to pride himself on having been born the
south side of the border. Skiddaw appeared
to our right, in a new form, and of more
impressive magnitude than when we first
beheld it at its foot, because we were aware
of the distance, and knew by experience
its height. During the whole of the first
stage the road inclined towards the mountains
which we had left:—we did not look
at them without something of regret, remembering
hours and days spent among
them, in that happy state of health, both
bodily and mental, which extracts enjoyment
even from difficulty and toil.</p>

<p>We breakfasted at Penrith. There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
the remains of a castle here on a little eminence,
which have been much dilapidated
of late;—a fine gateway has been pulled
down for the sake of the materials, and
after it had been demolished, the stones
were found to be so excellently cemented
together, that it was cheaper to dig fresh
ones than to separate them. This habit of
quarrying in castles and abbeys has been
fatal to some of the most interesting ruins
in England. Richard III. resided here
when Duke of Gloucester: the character
of this prince, like that of our Pedro, has
been vindicated by late historians; and the
prevailing opinion is, that he has been atrociously
calumniated to gratify the Tudors,
an able but a wicked race of princes. It
is a proof of his popular qualities at least,
that his memory is still in good odour here,
where he could not have been beloved unless
he had eminently deserved to be so,
because the country was attached to the
hostile party.</p>

<p>We had an intelligent companion on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
the roof, a native of the country, who
seemed to take a pleasure in communicating
information to us concerning it, perceiving
me to be a foreigner, and that I
listened to him with attention. This rendered
the next stage, for unfortunately
he proceeded no farther with us, particularly
interesting. The road ran parallel
with the sierra of Crossfell, at some little
distance from it; its length and uniformity
of outline so diminished its apparent
height, that I listened to him at first with
incredulity when he told me it exceeded
any of the mountains in the lake country:
yet books confirm his statement, and appearances
must not be weighed against
measurement. It formed a fine screen to
the east. Immediately near Penrith we
crossed two rivers which still retained the
wild character of mountain streams. The
country is beautiful, and its scenery enriched
by the ruins of many castles, the
strong-holds in former times of the Banditti
of the Border. These Borderers carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
the art of cow-stealing to its greatest
possible perfection; they are now reduced
to a state of subordination and law, and
their district is as orderly as any in the
kingdom; yet in those parts which are
remote from the great roads, though their
plundering habits are laid aside, they retain
much of their old rude manners and barbarous
spirit. An instance of this we
heard from our companion. A Borderer,
who was at mortal enmity with one of
his neighbours, fell sick, and, being given
over, sent for his enemy, that they might
be reconciled. "Ah," said he, when the
man entered the room, "I am very bad,
very bad indeed;—d'ye think I shall die?"
"Why, hope not," replied his visitor,—"hope
not;—to be sure you are very bad,
but for all that perhaps you may do yet."
"No, no," said the other, "I shall die, I
know I shall die,—and so I have sent for
you that I may not go out of the world in
enmity with any one. So, d'ye see, we'll
be friends. The quarrel between us is all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
over,—all over,—and so give me your
hand." Accordingly this token of reconciliation
was performed, and the other
took his leave; when, just as he was closing
the door after him, the sick man cried out,
"But stop," said he,—"if I should not
die this time, this is to go for nothing:
Mind now,—it's all to be just as it was
before, if I do not die."</p>

<p>Not far from Penrith is a pillar of stone,
well wrought, and formerly well emblazoned,
with dials on each side, and this inscription
upon a brazen plate:</p>

<p><i>This pillar was erected anno 1656, by
the Right Honourable Anne, Countess Dowager
of Pembroke, and sole heir of the right
honourable George Earl of Cumberland,
&amp;c., for a memorial of her last parting in
this place with her good and pious mother,
the right honourable Margaret Countess
Dowager of Cumberland, the 2d of April,
1616. In memory whereof she also left an
annuity of four pounds to be distributed to
the poor within the parish of Brougham every</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
<i>2d day of April, for ever, upon the Stone
Table hard by.</i></p>

<p>The little low stone table stands close
at hand, on which the distribution of this
alms is still made. I have seldom been
so interested by any monument or inscription,
as by this, which relates wholly to
the private feelings of an individual. She
was an admirable woman, and her name is
still held in veneration.</p>

<p>A little distant, though not in sight of
the road, is the scene of a circumstance
which I have seen more frequently related
than any other single anecdote in English
books: so deep an interest do these
people, one and all, take either in the
practice or the tales of hunting. It is the
park,—Whinfield is its name,—where a
hart was once started, and chased by a
single buck-hound from thence to Red
Kirk in Scotland, which is sixty English
miles off, and back again, thirty leagues in
all. The hart returned to die upon his
lair: he leaped the park pales, and expired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
immediately; and the hound, not having
strength for the leap, died on the outside.
Their heads were nailed against a hawthorn-tree,
with these lines under them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">Hercules killed Hart-o-Greece,</div>
<div class="verse">And Hart-o-Greece killed Hercules.</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>We passed through Kirkby Thur, that is,
the Church by Thor, one of the few etymological
vestiges of Saxon idolatry in
England. The worship of this god was
common in these parts; the name Thor
occurs in a pedigree, as that of the lord
of one of the manors in Cumberland.
Through Temple Sowerby next, where the
Knights Templars were once established.
It was not unusual formerly, for men who
found it necessary to limit their expenses
as much as possible, to retire into this
neighbourhood, where thirty years ago
they could live in a respectable family for
so small a pension as eighteen English
pounds;—a sort of banishment, for there
was then little intercourse between the
metropolis and these remote parts, and no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
stage coach nearer than York. Then we
reached Appleby, the county town of Westmoreland,
though apparently a smaller
place than Kendal. The road runs close
by it, but does not enter, a river dividing
it from the town. A castle, one of the
few which are still habitable, overlooks it
from a wooded eminence; the river and
bridge come into the foreground, and the
whole forms a highly beautiful scene. Here
we lost our companion. He told us that
Appleby was almost in as high a state of
faction about horse-racing as ever Constantinople
had been from the same cause.</p>

<p>The road, which was now become of a
drearier character, continued under Crossfell
till we approached Brough, when it
drew nearer to the sierra just at its termination.
Its sides were broken here with
rocks, and loose stones brought from above
by the frosts and torrents. Under it stood
some well-built houses, with a few trees
about them, not set thickly enough to look
like plantations, but as if of spontaneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
growth. The appearance of these houses,
wherein certainly the elegancies as well as
comforts of life would be found, formed
an impressive contrast with the dreariness
of the adjoining country, which was as
bleak and ungenial as the worst wastes of
Galicia. At Brough the coach dined, at
an hour unreasonably early, and at an inn
bad enough and dirty enough to be in character
with a beggarly town.</p>

<p>Our next stage was over the sierra of
Stainmoor, a cold and desolate tract. The
few houses upon the way bear testimony
to the severity of the climate; their roofs
are raised to as acute an angle as possible,
that the snow may not lie upon them,
which covers these heights probably all
the winter through. Since my first day's
journey in Cornwall, I have seen nothing
so desolate, and in this latitude the sky is
as cheerless as the earth. Beyond this is
the town of Bowes, which is in Yorkshire,
a huge province, as large as any
other three in the island. The town, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
all those which we have seen since Carlisle,
has its ruined castle, meant formerly
for protection against their marauding
neighbours, who long after the union of
the two kingdoms carried on incessant
hostilities against English beef and mutton.</p>

<p>At Bowes begins the great grazing
country for children.—It is the cheapest
part of England, and schools for boys
have long been established here, to which
tradesmen, and even some parents of
higher order who think money better than
learning, send their children from all the
great towns, even from the western provinces,—but
London supplies the greater
number. Two of these lads we took up,
who were returning to their parents in the
metropolis after a complete Yorkshire
education. One of them, who was just
fourteen, had been four years there, during
which time one of his sisters and his
father had died, and he had never seen
face of friend or kinsman. I asked him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
if he thought he should know his brothers
and sisters when he saw them: he said,
he supposed not; but presently, after a
pause, added with a smile in the dialect of
the country, "I think I shall ken 'em too."
This was an interesting lad with a quick
eye and a dyspeptic countenance. He
will be apprenticed behind some London
counter, or at a lawyer's desk, and die for
want of fresh air. His companion was a
fine, thriving, thick-headed fellow, with a
bottle belly and a bulbous nose; of that
happy and swinish temperament, that it
might be sworn he would feed and fatten
wherever he went.</p>

<p>These schools are upon the most œconomical
plan: a pension of sixteen pounds
sterling pays for everything, clothing included.
For certain they are kept upon
Spartan fare; but the boys, who were
from different schools, spake well of their
masters, and had evidently been happy
there. Sheets are considered as superfluous,
and clean linen as a luxury reserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
only for Sundays. They wash their own
clothes by means of a machine; and the
masters use no other labourers in getting
in their harvests both of hay and corn;
so that what with farming, teaching, and
a small cure, for they are generally priests,
they make the system answer. What is
taught is merely what is required for the
common purposes of life, to write well,
and be ready at the ordinary operations
of arithmetic. They profess to teach Latin,
but I could not find that the masters
ever ventured beyond the grammar. At
one of these schools they had been enacting
plays, to which the neighbourhood were
admitted at a price. Three pounds a night
had been their receipt, and this was divided
among the boys. Our little friend
related this with great satisfaction, told us
that he himself had played a part, and was
easily persuaded to give us one of his songs.
They had moveable scenes, he said, as
good as we should see in any theatre.—One
of these schools consists of Irish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
boys, and the master goes over every summer
to catch a drove of them.</p>

<p>A single house at Greta-Bridge was our
next stage, pleasantly situated beside a
clear rapid river in a woody country; but
after this single scene of beauty all was
flat and dismal. The road, however, had
this recommendation, that for league after
league it was as straight as the most impatient
traveller could wish it. At midnight
we left the coach at Borough-Bridge,
bidding adieu to the poor boys who had
forty hours to travel on.</p>

Borough-Bridge, which is a little
town full of good inns, we took chaise in
the morning for York. The road was a
straight line over a dead flat; the houses
which we passed of red brick, roofed with
red tiles, uglier than common cottages,
and not promising more comfort within.
York is one of the few English cities with
the name of which foreigners are familiar.
I was disappointed that its appearance in
the distance was not finer,—we saw its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
huge cathedral rising over the level,—but
that was all; and I found that the second
city in England was as little imposing as
the metropolis upon a first view. We
drove under an old gateway and up a narrow
street, ordered dinner at the inn, and
set out to see the cathedral, here called the
minster.</p>

<p>Though I had seen the cathedral churches
of Exeter, Salisbury, Westminster, and
Worcester, my expectations were exceeded
here; for though on the outside something,
I know not what, is wanting, the
interior surpasses any thing to be seen
elsewhere. It is in magnitude that York
minster is unrivalled; it is of the best age
of Gothic, and in admirable repair:—this
praise must be given to the English heretics,
that they preserve these monuments
of magnificent piety with a proper care,
and do not suffer them to be disfigured by
the barbarism of modern times. Here indeed
we felt the full effect of this wonderful
architecture, in which all the parts are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
highly ornamented, yet the multiplicity
of ornaments contributes to one great
impression. We ascended the tower by
such a wearying round of steps that I was
compelled to judge more respectfully of
its height, than we had done when beholding
it from below. The day was hazy; we
saw however sufficiently far into a flat
country; and the city, and the body of
the immense building below us, with its
towers and turrets, its buttresses and battlements,
were objects far more impressive
than any distant view.</p>

<p>Having satisfied our curiosity here, we
strolled in search of other objects, saw the
castle, which is converted into a prison,
and found our way to a public walk beside
the river Ouse, a sluggish and muddy
stream, which, however, as it is navigable,
the people of York would be loth to
exchange for one of the wild Cumberland
rivers, which we could not but remember
with regret. There is a bridge over it of
remarkable architecture, whose irregular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
arches, with the old houses adjoining,
form a highly picturesque pile. While we
were looking at it, we heard some one
from the ships sing out, "There he goes!"
and this was repeated from vessel to vessel,
and from shore to shore, chiefly by
boys and children, in a regular tone, and
at regular intervals, almost like minute
guns. It was some time, before we paid
any attention to this; but at last it was repeated
so often that it forced itself upon
our notice, and we enquired of a woman,
whose little girl was joining in the cry,
what it meant. She told us it was a man,
then crossing at the ferry, whom the children
always called after in this way:—she
could give no further account, and did not
know that he had done any thing to provoke
it. He was a man in years, and of
decent appearance. It is possible that he
may have committed some offence which
drew upon him the public notice,—but it
is equally possible that this was begun in
sport; and if so, as the woman indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
understood it to be, it is one of the strangest
instances of popular persecution I ever
witnessed. Age and deformity, I may
here remark, are always objects of ridicule
in England; it is disgraceful to the
nation to see how the rabble boys are permitted
to torment a poor idiot, if they find
one in the streets.</p>

<p class="gap-above2 center x-spaced">*****</p>

<div class="top">
<div class="small right1">Thursday.</div>
</div>

<p>At five in the morning we left York,
I could not but admire the punctuality of
the old coachman. He was on his box,
we on the roof,—every thing ready to start.
One church clock struck,—another followed,—house
clocks all around us,—"All
but the minster," said the old man,—for
the minster was his signal. Presently
that began with its finer tone,—and before
the first quarter had ended, crack went
his whip and we were off. It was a cloudy
morning,—we passed through Tadcaster,
and a few smaller places not worth naming,
because not worth remembering, till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
we reached Ferry-bridge to breakfast. The
bridge is new and handsome, yet our
bridges are in a better taste than those of
the English:—the river, a slow stream,
as dull and uninteresting as a canal. On
to Doncaster, one of the handsomest towns
I have ever seen:—the country around is
as insipid as the plains of Old Castille,
though perhaps the Doncastrians are of a
different opinion, as their race-ground is
one of the best in England. The scenery
improved when we entered the province
of Nottinghamshire, and the sun came out
and brightened every thing; here we saw
a few hop-gardens. Our places were taken
to an inn called Markham Moor, from
whence we expected to reach Lincoln time
enough to see it easily that evening. It
was nineteen miles from the inn: they
told us they had no chaise at home, and
must send for one from Tuxford, therefore
we had better go on to Tuxford, which
was two miles further, and then we should
be one mile nearer Lincoln. To this we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
readily agreed,—but our coach dined at
this Markham Moor,—here would be an
hour lost, ill to be spared when we were
prest for time: another stage passed us
while we were deliberating, and by the
landlord's especial advice we mounted this
and advanced. Lincoln cathedral was distinctly
in sight at this distance.</p>

<p>At Tuxford we ordered chaise for Lincoln,
which we had been told was eighteen
miles distant,—the waiter said it was
twenty, the landlady that it was twenty-one.
"Why have they no <i>Corregidores</i> in
England?" said I to my companion, who
wished as heartily, but as vainly, as myself
for summary redress. The woman knew
that we knew we were imposed on, and
expressed it in her countenance and manner.
There was no remedy but the never-failing
panacea of patience. Mark the
complication of roguery.—Instead of taking
a cross road, which would have cut off
two miles, we were driven back to Markham
Moor, by which excellent manœuvre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
we had to pay for twenty-one, instead of
nineteen, and an additional turnpike into
the bargain. We called at this inn, and
asked for the landlord, meaning to tell
him our opinion of his conduct; but he
did not choose to appear. No class of
people in England require the superintendance
of law more than the inn-keepers.
They fix their own prices, without any
other restriction than their own conscience,
and uniformly charge the fraction
of a mile as a whole one, so that the
traveller pays for a mile, in almost every
stage, more than he travels. False weights
and measures are punishable here, why
should this kind of measure be exempted?</p>

<p>When we had proceeded about half a
league further, the driver dismounted to
open a gate. Just on the other side was a
little bridge over a ditch of clear and slowly-flowing
water: the wall of this bridge was
continued far enough, as might have been
supposed, for security, and then sloped
aside from the road, and ended. By the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
side of the road was a steep bank, not
higher than with a bound one might spring
up; at the bottom of this was a young
hedge fenced with rails on both sides, at
right angles with the ditch-stream. Our
horses went on before the driver could remount,
and they chose to bend this way;
the chaise was soon in such a situation that
it was prudent for us with all speed to
alight; he held the horses and out we got;
but to get them into the road was not so
easy. Both were spirited beasts, indeed
we had been admiring them;—both were
startlish, and the mare vicious;—she had
lately run with a chaise into the river at
Newark, and drowned the post-boy. They
began to plunge,—the weight of the chaise,
which was on the declivity, pressed upon
them, the horse leapt at the rails and
broke them down, the mare fell in the
bottom, and had the bank been in the
slightest degree steeper the chaise must
have rolled upon her. As it was, we expected
to see her killed, or her bones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
broken at least. D. called to the driver to
cut the traces instantly and let the horse
loose, or he would frighten the mare still
more, and make bad worse:—he hesitated
to do this till after more plunging the
mare got into the ditch:—however, the
traces were loosed, and the beasts got into
the road with little other hurt than the
violent agitation they were in. We now
exerted all our strength to drag up the
chaise, but to no purpose. D. went one
way for help, the driver another, while I
sate upon the wall of the bridge and looked
at the stream. D. brought with him a
man and two boys, and the driver a carthorse,
who soon did the business,—and we
proceeded not without some apprehensions
of another accident, from the fear of the
horses, but, thanks be to God, all went on
well.</p>

<p>We came presently to Dunham Ferry,—the
interruption and expence of crossing
here were well compensated by the beauty
of the scene. The Trent at this place is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
the largest fresh-water river which I have
seen in England,—indeed I believe it rolls
a greater body of fresh water to the sea
than any other. Two of its huge arms,
which embraced a long island, met just
above the ferry, like two large rivers. The
opposite bank was high and broken. The
island terminated in a sharp point, to
which the stream had worn it, and just at
this point were about a score or five-and-twenty
remarkably large willow-trees, as
tall as elms. Some men of taste must
have planted them two centuries ago;
the rest of the island, as far as we could see,
was fine meadow land,—and a colony of
rooks had established their commonwealth
in the trees. The country up the river
was a dead flat, with a handsome church
in the distance, and another on the shore
which we were leaving; many little islands,
with a bush or two upon them, in
the stream below,—the price at the ferry
was half-a-crown, which we thought exorbitantly
dear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
The road now ran between plantations of
birch, oak, beech, and hazel, with ditches
of clear weedy water on each side, which
sometimes spread into little pools in which
the overhanging boughs and bank weeds
were reflected,—a complete contrast to the
mountain streams, and yet beautiful. It
opened upon a marsh, and we once more
beheld the cathedral upon its height, now
two leagues distant. This magnificent
building stands at the end of a long and
high hill, above the city. To the north
there are nine windmills in a row. It has
three towers, the two smaller ones topped
with the smallest spires I have ever seen;—they
were beautiful in the distance—yet we
doubted whether they ought to have been
there, and in fact they are of modern addition,
and not of stone, so that on a near
view they disgrace and disfigure the edifice.
Imagine this seen over a wide plain,
this the only object,—than which the power
of man could produce no finer. The
nearer we approached the more dreary was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
the country—it was one wide fen,—but
the more beautiful the city, and the more
majestic the cathedral: Never was an edifice
more happily placed; it overtops a city
built on the acclivity of a steep hill,—its
houses intermingled with gardens and orchards.
To see it in full perfection, it
should be in the red sunshine of an autumnal
evening, when the red roofs, and
red brick houses would harmonize with
the sky and the fading foliage.</p>

<p>Our disasters had delayed us till it was
too late to see the church. So we sate
down to a late dinner upon some of the
wild fowl of the fens.</p>

<div class="top">
<div class="small right1">Friday.</div>
</div>

<p>The exterior of Lincoln cathedral is far
more beautiful than that of York, the inside
is far inferior. They have been obliged
in some places to lay a beam from
one column to another, to strengthen
them; they have covered it with Gothic
work, and it appears at first like a continuation
of the passages above. It is to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
wished that in their other modern works
there had been the same approximation to
the taste of better times. A fine Roman
pavement was discovered not many years
ago in the centre of the cloister; they have
built a little brick building over it to preserve
it with commendable care; but so
vile a one as to look like one of those
houses of necessity which are attached to
every cottage in this country—and which
it is to be hoped will one day become as
general in our own. A library forms one
side of the cloister-quadrangle, which is
also modern and mean. Another vile
work of modern time is a picture of the
Annunciation over the altar.</p>

<p>Most of the old windows were demolished
in the days of fanaticism; their
place has not been supplied with painted
glass,—and from the few which remain,
the effect of the coloured light crowning
the little crockets and pinnacles, and playing
upon the columns with red and purple
and saffron shades of light, made us the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
more regret that all were not in the same
state of beauty. We ascended the highest
tower, crossing a labyrinth of narrow passages;
it was a long and wearying way,—the
jackdaws who inhabit these steeples
have greatly the advantage of us in getting
to the top of them. How very much must
these birds be obliged to man for building
cathedrals for their use! It is something
higher than York, and the labour of climbing
it was compensated by a bird's eye
view all around us.</p>

<p>We ascended one of the other towers
afterwards to see Great Tom, the largest
bell in England. At first it disappointed
me, but the disappointment wore off, and
we became satisfied that it was as great a
thing as it was said to be. A tall man
might stand in it, upright; the mouth
measures one and twenty English feet in
circumference, and it would be a large
tree of which the girth equalled the size
of its middle. The hours are struck upon
it with a hammer. I should tell you that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
the method of sounding bells in England
is not by striking, but by swinging them:
no bell, however, which approaches nearly
to the size of this is ever moved, except
this; it is swung on Whitsunday, and when
the judges arrive to try the prisoners,—another
fit occasion would be at executions,
to which it would give great solemnity, for
the sound is heard far and wide over the
fens. On other occasions it was disused,
because it shook the tower, but the stones
have now been secured with iron cramps.—Tom,
which is the familiar abbreviation
of Thomas, seems to be the only name
which they give to a bell in this country.</p>

<p>Only one coach passes through Lincoln
on the way to London, and that early in
the morning, we were therefore obliged
to return again into the great north road,
which we did by taking chaise to Newark;
the road is a straight line, along an old Roman
way. A bridge over the Trent and the
ruins of a castle, which long held out for
the king in the great civil war, are the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
remarkable objects in this town,—except
indeed that I saw the name <i>Ordoyno</i> over
a shop. The day ended in rain; we got
into a stage in the evening, which took us
through the towns of Grantham, Stamford,
and Stilton, and dropt us in the middle of
the night at a single inn called Alconbury-Hill,—where
after a few minutes we succeeded
in obtaining admittance and went
to bed.</p>

From Alconbury-Hill to Cambridge is two
short stages,—we passed through Huntingdon,
the birth-place of Oliver Cromwell,
and travelled over a dismal flat, the
country northward being one great fen.
The whole of these extensive fens is said
once to have been dry and productive
ground reduced to this state by some earthquake
or deluge, unremembered in history.
Tools found beneath the soil, and
submersed forests, are the proofs. A century
and half ago they began to drain them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
and the draining still proceeds. In old
times they were the favourite retreat of the
religious: the waters were at that time carried
off by great rivers through the level,
above twenty leagues long, which formed
innumerable lakes, many of them of considerable
size, and on the islands in these
a hermitage or a convent was placed in
safety from the sudden attack of the Northern
Sea Kings, and in that solitude which
its holy inhabitants desired. The greater
number of the old English saints flourished
in this district.</p>

<p>A singular custom prevailed here about
fourscore years ago, and perhaps may not
yet be wholly discontinued. The corpse
was put into the ground a few hours after
death, and about a week afterwards they
buried an empty coffin with funeral ceremonies.
Possibly this strange peculiarity
may have been introduced upon occasion
of some pestilence, when it would have
been dangerous to keep the body longer.
The body is always kept some days in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
England, usually till signs of decay appear.</p>

<p>At length we came in sight of Cambridge:—How
inferior to the first view of
Oxford! yet its lofty buildings and old
trees gave it a characteristic appearance,
and were more beautiful because in the
midst of such a dreary land. The streets
are narrow, and the greater number of the
colleges mean brick buildings; there is,
however, one edifice, the Chapel of King's
College, which exceeds any thing in Oxford,
and probably in the world. This unrivalled
edifice is dedicated to Mary the
most pure and to St Nicholas. It was finished
by the arch-apostate Henry VIII.,
when he had just effected his adulterous
marriage with Anne Boleyn, and here
their names appear twined together with
true lovers' knots, the only place where his
initials remain joined with hers.</p>

<p>In this university are sixteen colleges.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_11" id="Ref_11" href="#Foot_11">[11]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
The principal one is dedicated to the most
holy Trinity; it consists of two handsome
squares, or quadrangles as they are
called, the larger of which the Cantabrigians
would fain believe to be finer than
the great quadrangle of Christ Church at
Oxford, of which they may perhaps persuade
those who have never been at Oxford.
The Library, the Chapel, and the
Refectory were shown to us; the two latter
are little curious, but in the anti-chapel is
a statue of the great Newton by Roubiliac,
a name of great eminence in this country.
It is a good example of Vandyke in marble,
and that will give you the best idea
of its style and excellence. The sculptor
has endeavoured to make it picturesque, by
representing the texture and the light and
shade of silk in the drapery; and as the
vulgar can always comprehend dexterity
of hand, and can seldom comprehend any
thing above it, the statue has obtained
much admiration for its faults.</p>

<p>The Library is a most magnificent room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
about an hundred paces in length, with
a painted window at the end, of which it
would not be easy to say whether the design
or the execution be most faulty: in
this, Minerva, Bacon, George&nbsp;III., and
Newton are all brought together in their
respective costumes. Besides a splendid
collection of books, there is a cabinet of
medals here, but they are seldom shown
lest they should be stolen, as books frequently
have been. It is singular that in
the public libraries and collections of
England there are more precautions taken
against thieves than in any other country
in Europe. It is not often I understand
when an offender is discovered that the
law is enforced against him; but now and
then, the librarian said, they were obliged
to make an example; and he turned to a
MS. Catalogue, and showed us a record
that a member of the University had been
degraded for seven years for this offence.
In the University library we were shown
several books which had been stolen, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
the title-pages nearly cut out, in order to
avoid detection. Offences of this kind,
though in their consequences so truly abominable,
seem to be little thought of.
Indeed, it should appear that the English
scarcely think it any crime to plunder the
public in any way.</p>

<p>I had an introduction to a resident member
of <span class="squash">——</span> ; it proved a very valuable
one, and there are few of my English
friends from whose conversation I have
derived so much instruction. The objects
of curiosity in Cambridge were soon seen,
but we remained a few days there, for the
pleasure of his society. The University was
almost empty, it being now the vacation
time. There is a greater variety of dresses
here than at Oxford, the colleges not
dressing all alike, and some wearing purple
instead of black. The privileged class
also wear a hat instead of the academical
cap. A round church of the Templars,
built after the Holy Sepulchre, is one of
the most remarkable things in this university.—I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
was pleased too with the sight
of a huge concave celestial globe, in the
midst of which you stand, and it revolves
round you. The Cam, a lazy stream,
winds behind the town and through the
college walks, collecting filth as it goes.
"Yonder," said our friend, "are the Gogmagog
Hills;"—in spite of their gigantic
appellation they are so very like a plain,
that I looked all around to see where they
were.</p>

<p class="gap-above2 center x-spaced">*****</p>

<p class="gap-above2">"What a happy life," said I to our Cambridge
friend, "must you lead in your
English universities! You have the advantages
of a monastery without its restrictions,
the enjoyments of the world without
its cares,—the true <i>otium cum dignitate</i>."
He shook his head and answered, "It is a
joyous place for the young, and a convenient
place for all of us,—but for none is
it a happy one—and he soon convinced
me that I was mistaken in the favourable
judgment which I had formed. I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
endeavour to retrace the substance of a
long and interesting evening's conversation.</p>

<p>It is a joyous place for the young,—joy
and happiness however are not synonymous.
They come hither from school,
no longer to be treated as children; their
studies and their amusement are almost at
their own discretion, and they have money
at command. But as at college they first
assume the character of man, it is there
also that they are first made to feel their
relative situation in society. Schools in
England, especially those public ones from
which the universities are chiefly supplied,
are truly republican. The master perhaps
will pay as much deference to rank as he
possibly can, and more than he honestly
ought:—it is, however, but little that he
can pay the institutions have been too
wisely framed to be counteracted, and titles
and families are not regarded by the
boys. The distinctions which they make
are in the spirit of a barbarous, not of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
commercial calculating people; bodily endowments
hold the first, mental the second
place. The best bruiser enjoys the highest
reputation; next to him, but after a long
interval, comes the best cricket-player,
the third place, at a still more respectful
distance, is allowed to the cleverest,
who, in the opinion of his fellows, always
takes place of the best scholar. In the
world,—and the college is not out of it
like the cloister,—all this is reversed into
its right order; but the gifts of fortune
are placed above all. Whatever habits and
feelings of equality may have been generated
at school, are to be got rid of at
college,—and this is soon done. The first
thing which the new student perceives on
his arrival, is, that his school-fellows, who
are there before him, pass him in the
streets as if they knew him not, and perhaps
stare him full in the face, that he
may be sure it is not done through inadvertency.
The ceremony of introduction
must take place before two young men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
who for years have eaten at the same table,
studied in the same class, and perhaps
slept in the same chamber,—can possibly
know each other when they meet at college.</p>

<p>There is to be found every where a great
number of those persons whom we cannot
prove to be human beings by any rational
characteristic which they possess; but who
must be admitted to be so, by a sort of
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, because they cannot
possibly be any thing else. They pass
for men, in the world, because it has
pleased God for wise purposes, however
inscrutable to us, to set them upon two
legs instead of four; to give them smooth
skins and no tail, and to enable them to
speak without having their tongues slit.
They are like those weeds which will
spring up and thrive in every soil and every
climate, and which no favourable circumstances
can ever improve into utility.
It is of little consequence whether they
shoot water-fowl, attend horse-races, frequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
the brothel, and encourage the wine
trade in one place or another; but as a
few years of this kind of life usually satisfy
a man for the rest of it, it is convenient
that there should be a place appointed
where one of this description can pass
through this course of studies out of sight
of his relations, and without injuring his
character; and from whence he can come
with the advantage of having been at the
University, and a qualification which enables
him to undertake the cure of souls.
The heretical bishops never enquire into
the moral conduct of those upon whom
they lay their unhallowed hands,—and as
for the quantity of learning which is required,—M.
Maillardet, who exhibits his
Androeides in London, could put enough
into an automaton.</p>

<p>Such men as these enjoy more happiness,
such as their happiness is, at the University
than during any other part of their lives.
It is a pleasant place also for the lilies of
the world, they who have neither to toil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
nor to spin; but for those who have the
world before them, there is perhaps no
place in their whole journey where they
feel less at ease. It is the port from whence
they are to embark,—and who can stand
upon the beach and look upon the sea
whereon he is about to trust himself and
his fortunes, without feeling his heart sink
at the uncertainty of the adventure? True
it is that these reflections do not continue
long upon a young man's mind, yet they
occur so often as insensibly to affect its
whole feelings. The way of life is like the
prospect from his window,—he beholds it
not while he is employed, but in the intervals
of employment, when he lifts up his
eyes, the prospect is before him. The frequent
change of his associates is another
melancholy circumstance. A sort of periodical
and premature mortality takes place
among his friends: term after term they
drop off to their respective allotments,
which are perhaps so distant from his own,
that years may elapse, or the whole lease of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
life be run out, before he ever again meets
with the man whom habits of daily and
intimate intercourse had endeared to him.</p>

<p>Let us now suppose the student to be
successful in his collegiate pursuits, he obtains
a fellowship,—and is, in the opinion
of his friends, provided for for life. Settled
for life he would indeed have been according
to the original institution, and it
still is a provision for him as long as he retains
it,—but mark the consequences of
the schism,—of altering the parts of an
establishment without considering their relations
to the whole. A certain number of
benefices belong to the college, to which,
as they become vacant, the fellows succeed
according to seniority, vacating their fellowships
by accepting a benefice, or by
marrying. Here one of the evils of a married
clergy is perceived. Where celibacy
is never regarded as a virtue, it is naturally
considered as a misfortune. Attachments
are formed more easily perhaps in
this country than in any other, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
there is little restraint in the intercourse
between the sexes, and all persons go so
much from home into public. But the situation
of the college-fellow who has engaged
his affections is truly pitiable. Looking
with envious eyes at those above him
on the list, and counting the ages of those
who hold the livings for which he is to
wait, he passes years after years in this
disquieting and wretched state of hope.
The woman, in like manner, wears away
her youth in dependent expectation, and
they meet at last, if they live to meet, not
till the fall of the leaf—not till the habits
and tempers of both are become fixt and
constitutional, so as no longer to be capable
of assimilating each to the other.</p>

<p>I enquired what were the real advantages
of these institutions to the country at large,
and to the individuals who study in them.
"They are of this service," he replied,
"to the country at large, that they are the
great schools by which established opinions
are inculcated and perpetuated. I do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
know that men gain much here, yet it is a
regular and essential part of our system of
education, and they who have not gone
through it always feel that their education
has been defective. A knowledge of the
world, that is to say, of our world and of
the men in it, is gained here, and that
knowledge remains when Greek and geometry
are forgotten." I asked him which
was the best of the two universities; he answered
that Cambridge was as much superior
to Oxford, as Oxford was to Salamanca.
I could not forbear smiling at his
scale of depreciation: he perceived it, and
begged my pardon, saying, that he as little
intended to undervalue the establishments
of my country, as to overrate the
one of which he was himself a member.
"We are bad enough," said he, "Heaven
knows, but not so bad as Oxford. They
are now attempting to imitate us in some
of those points wherein the advantage on
our part is too notorious to be disputed.
The effect may be seen in another generation,—meantime
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
the imitation is a confession
of inferiority."</p>

<p>"Still," said I, "we may regard the universities
as the seats of learning and of the
Muses." "As for the Muses, sir," said he,
"you have traversed the banks of the Cam,
and must know whether you have seen
any nine ladies there who answer their
description. We do certainly produce
verses both Greek and Latin which are
worthy of gold medals, and English ones
also, after the newest and most approved
receipt for verse-making. Of leading,
such as is required for the purposes of tuition
there is much,—beyond it, except in
mathematics, none. In this we only
share the common degeneracy. The Mohammedans
believe that when Gog and
Magog are to come, the race of men will
have dwindled to such littleness, that a
shoe of one of the present generation will
serve them for a house. If this prophecy
be typical of the intellectual diminution
of the species, Gog and Magog may soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
be expected in the neighbourhood of their
own hills."</p>

<p>"The truth is, sir," he continued, "that
the institutions of men grow old like men
themselves, and, like women, are always
the last to perceive their own decay. When
universities were the only schools of learning
they were of great and important utility;
as soon as there were others, they
ceased to be the best, because their forms
were prescribed, and they could adopt no
improvement till long after it was generally
acknowledged. There are other causes
of decline.—We educate for only one profession:
when colleges were founded that
one was the most important; it is now
no longer so; they who are destined for
the others find it necessary to study elsewhere,
and it begins to be perceived that
this is not a necessary stage upon the road.
This might be remedied. We have professors
of every thing, who hold their situations
and do nothing. In Edinburgh
the income of the professor depends upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
his exertions, and in consequence the reputation
of that university is so high, that
Englishmen think it necessary to finish
their education by passing a year there.
They learn shallow metaphysics there,
and come back worse than they went,
inasmuch as it is better to be empty than
flatulent."</p>

<p class="gist"><i>Newmarket.—Cruelty of Horse-racing.—Process
of Wasting.—Character of a
Man of the Turf.—Royston.—Buntingford.—Cheshunt.—Return
to London.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">T</span><span class="smc">hree</span>
leagues from Cambridge is the
town of Newmarket, famous for its adjoining
race-ground, the great scene of
English extravagance and folly. They who
have seen the races tell me it is a fine
sight:—the horses are the most perfect
animals of their kind, and their speed is
wonderful; but it is a cruel and detestable
sport. The whip and the spur are unmercifully
used. Some of the leading men of
the turf, as they are called, will make
their horses run two or three times in as
many days, till every fibre in them is sore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
and they are disabled for ever by over exertion.
Whatever pleasure, therefore, a
man of clean conscience might lawfully
have taken in beholding such sports, when
they were instituted (if such was their origin)
for the sake of improving the breed,
and were purely trials of swiftness, is at an
end. The animal, who evidently delights
in the outset, and ambitiously strains himself
to his full length and speed, is lashed
and gored till his blood mingles with his
foam, because his owner has staked thousands
upon the issue of the race: and so
far is this practice from tending to the improvement
of the breed, that at present it
confessedly injures it, because horses are
brought to the course before they have
grown to their full strength, and are thereby
prevented from ever attaining to it.</p>

<p>It is hardly less hurtful to the riders;
their sufferings, however, would rather excite
mirth than compassion, if any thing
connected with the degradation of a
human being could be regarded without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
some sense of awe and humiliation. These
gentlemen are called jockeys. Jockeyship
is a particular trade in England;—I beg its
pardon—a profession. A few persons retain
one in their establishment, but in general
they go to Newmarket and offer their
services for the occasion. Three guineas
are the fee for riding a race; if much be
depending upon it, as is usually the case,
the winner receives a present. Now, in
these matches the weight which the horses
are to carry is always stipulated. Should
the jockey be too light, he carries something
about him to make up the due number
of pounds; but if unhappily he exceeds
this number, he must undergo a
course of wasting. Had Procrustes heard
of this invention, he would have made all
travellers equal in weight as well as in measure,
and his balance would have been as
famous as his bed. In order to get rid of
this supererogatory flesh they are purged
and sweated; made to take long walks
with thick clothing on; then immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
on their return drink cold water, and stew
between two feather beds, and in this manner
melt themselves down to the lawful
standard. One of the most eminent of
these jockeys lately wasted eighteen pounds
in three days; so violent a reduction that
it is supposed he will never recover
from it.</p>

<p>Our friend here once heard the character
of one of the great Newmarket heroes
from a groom. Mr <span class="squash">——</span> , said the man,
was the best sportsman on the turf; he
would bet upon any thing and to any sum,
and make such matches as nobody else
could ever have thought of making, only
it was a pity that he was such a fool—he
was a fool to be sure. It was difficult to
say whether the fellow was most impressed
by the absolute folly of his hero, or by his
undaunted love of gambling; the one he
could not speak of without admiration,
and he laughed while he was bemoaning
the other: for certain, he said, there was
nobody like him for spirit,—he was ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
for any thing; but then unluckily he was
such a cursed fool. To be sure he was
losing his fortune as fast as it could go.
But his comfort was, he used to say, that
when all was gone he was sure of a place,
for his friend Lord <span class="squash">——</span> had promised
to make him his whipper-in.</p>

<p>The pedigree of the horse is as carefully
preserved as that of the master; and can
in many instances be traced further back.
In general the English horses are less beautiful
than ours, and they are disfigured by
the barbarous custom of mutilating the
tail and ears. Dogs suffer the same cruel
mutilation. It is surprising how little use
is made of the ass here; it is employed
only by the lowest people in the vilest services;
miserably fed and more miserably
treated. Mules are seldom seen: in Elizabeth's
days a large male ass which had
been brought from France into Cornwall
began a fabric of them, and the people
knocked them on the head for monsters
as soon as they were foaled.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></div>

<p class="gap-above2 center x-spaced">*****</p>

<p>Had it been the racing season I should
have gone to Newmarket; the ground itself,
celebrated as it is, did not tempt me.
Our friend was going to the immediate vicinity
of London; so having his company
we travelled by chaise, the expense for three
persons not materially exceeding that of
going by stage. Royston was our first post.
In this neighbourhood there was a man
lately who believed himself entitled to a
large estate which was wrongfully withheld
from him; he worked at some daily labour,
and his custom was to live as penuriously
as was possible, and expend the savings of
the whole year in giving a dinner upon his
birth-day at a public-house upon the estate,
to which he invited by public notices all
persons who would please to come. D.
remembers in his childhood a man, who,
under the same feeling, had vowed never to
put on clean linen, wash himself, shave
his beard, comb his hair, or cut his nails,
till he had recovered his right; a vow which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
he kept during the remainder of his life, and
died in his dirt. They called him Black
John, and he was the terror of children.</p>

<p>At Buntingford is a mansion built about
two centuries ago, of which they say that
when the house was built the staircase was
forgotten; a common story this of all those
old houses which have the winding turret
staircase: something more remarkable is,
that it has a room to which there is no entrance.
By Ware we saw the New River:
a canal which begins there and supplies
great part of London with water,—sufficiently
filthy it must needs be, for it is open
the whole way, and as it approaches the
suburbs is the common bathing-place of
the rabble,—yet the Londoners are perfectly
contented with it! We passed through
Cheshunt, a village memorable as being the
place where Richard Cromwell lived in
peace and privacy to a good old age, and
died<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_12" id="Ref_12" href="#Foot_12">[12]</a></span> as he had lived,—a happier man than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
his more illustrious father. Here also was
the favourite palace of James&nbsp;I.; it has
been demolished; but a moss walk under
a long avenue of elms, a part of his gardens,
is still preserved. Near this is a
cross at Waltham, one of those which Edward&nbsp;I.
erected at every place where the
body of his excellent queen halted on the
way to its burial. It is a beautiful monument
of pious antiquity, though mutilated
and otherwise defaced by time. Nothing
else worthy of notice occurred on
the road, which lay through the province
of Hertfordshire. The country, though

<p class="gist"><i>Middlesex Election.—Nottingham Election.—Seats

Elections.—Marriages at

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">D</span><span class="smc">uring</span>
my travels I have missed the
sight of a popular election. That for Middlesex
has been carried on with uncommon
asperity; it is the only instance wherein
the ministry have exerted their influence;
for, contrary to the custom of all their predecessors,
they have fairly trusted themselves
to the opinion of the people. Here,
however, they have taken a part,—and here
they have been beaten, because they stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
upon the very worst ground which they
could possibly have chosen.</p>

<p>The English have a law called the <i>habeas
corpus</i>, which they regard, with good reason,
as the main pillar of their freedom.
By this law it is the right of every person
who is arrested upon a criminal charge, to
be tried at the first sessions after his arrest;
so that, while this law continues in force,
no person can be wrongfully detained in
prison, but his guilt or innocence must be
fairly proved. It was thought expedient to
suspend this statute during the late revolutionary
ferment. The place chosen for
the suspected persons was a prison in the
immediate suburb of the metropolis; being
one of the new buildings upon the fashionable
plan. Complaints were made by the
prisoners of cruel usage, and Sir Francis
Burdett, a young man who has warmly
espoused the popular party, brought the
business forward in parliament. A wise
minister would have listened to the complaint,
examined into it, and redressed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
grievance, even ostentatiously; for the object
of government being to secure these
men, and it being also notorious that there
was no legal proof of guilt against them,
as if there had they would have been
brought to trial, all rigour not absolutely
necessary for the purposes of confinement,
appeared like a determination to punish
them in every way they could, and consequently
as an act of arbitrary and cruel
power. But pride and obstinacy are the
predominant parts of Mr Pitt's character;
right or wrong he never yields; and he now
chose to show his power by protecting the
gaoler in defiance of public opinion. Repeated
complaints were made; and it was
affirmed upon oath that a Colonel Despard,
one of these prisoners, had been confined
there in a cell without windows, and without
fire, till his feet were ulcered with
the frost. At length a deputation was
named to inspect the prison:—it consisted
chiefly of persons disposed to see every
thing with favourable eyes; and, as you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
may well suppose, the prison was prepared
for their visitation. When they came into
the cell where a sailor was confined who
had been concerned in the great mutiny,
one of the deputies noticed a bird which
hopped about him, and said how tame it
was. "Aye, sir," said the man, "this place
will tame any thing!" and though a hardy
English sailor, he burst into tears. The
report was in favour of the prison. Complaints,
however, were still continued. The
place acquired the name of the Bastille;
and merely upon the ground of having
raised his voice in parliament against this
new species of punishment, Sir Francis
Burdett has become the most popular man
in England. He offered himself as candidate
for Middlesex. The ministry acted
unwisely in opposing him; and still more
unwisely in supporting against him a man
who had no other possible claim to their
support, than that he was implicated in
the charges against the management of the
prison, because he was one of the magistrates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
whose duty it was to inspect it, and
he had given it his full approbation. By
this impolicy they made the question of
the Middlesex election to be this,—whether
this system of imprisonment was approved
of by the people or not; and the
answer has been most undeniably given
against them.</p>

<p>Electioneering, as they call it, is a game
at which every kind of deceit seems to be
considered lawful. On these occasions,
men, who at other times regard it as a duty
to speak truth, and think their honour implicated
in their word, scruple not at asserting
the grossest and most impudent
falsehoods, if thereby they can obtain a
momentary advantage over the hostile
party. A striking instance of this has occurred
with respect to the election for Nottingham,
a considerable town in the middle
of England, where the contest has been
violent, because party-spirit has always
been carried to a high degree there. Some
years ago the mob ducked those who were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
most obnoxious to them, and killed some
of them in the operation. This was not
forgotten. The opposite party had the
ascendancy now, and those who were noted
as having been active in this outrageous
cruelty were severely handled. In such
cases of summary justice the innocent are
liable to suffer with the guilty, and the
rabble, when they had got the power, abused
it. Whoever voted for the obnoxious
candidate had the skirts of his coat cut off,
and it was well if he escaped without
further injury. It might have been thought
that the plain statement of these facts
would have sufficed to show that the election
was not a fair one; but instead of being
satisfied with a plain tale, a gentleman
comes forward as the advocate of the unsuccessful
party, accuses all the other party
of the most violent jacobinism, and asserts
that at the triumph of the winning candidate
the tree of liberty was carried before
him, and that a naked woman walked in
the procession as the Goddess of Reason.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
The history of the tree is, that as the candidate's
name happened to be Birch, a
birch bough was borne in his honour: the
other falsehood is so apparent that no person
supposes this writer can possibly believe
it himself. It is a pious fraud to answer
a party purpose, and on such occasions
no frauds, pious or impious, are
scrupled.</p>

<p>Any thing like election, in the plain sense
of the word, is unknown in England.
Members are never chosen for parliament
as deputies were for a Cortes, because they
are the fittest persons to be deputed. Some
seats are private property;—that is, the
right of voting belongs to a few householders,
sometimes not more than half a
dozen, and of course these votes are commanded
by the owner of the estate. The
fewer they are, the more easily they are
managed. Great part of a borough in the
west of England was consumed some
years ago by fire, and the lord of the manor
would not suffer the houses to be rebuilt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
for this reason. If such an estate be
to be sold, it is publicly advertised as carrying
with it the power of returning two
members; sometimes that power is veiled
under the modest phrase of <i>a valuable appendage
to the estate</i>, or <i>the desirable privilege
of nominating to seats in a certain
assembly</i>. Government hold many of
these boroughs, and individuals buy in at
others. The price is as well known as the
value of land, or of stock, and it is not
uncommon to see a seat in a certain house
advertised for in the public newspapers.
In this manner are a majority of the members
returned. You will see then that the
house of commons must necessarily be a
manageable body. This is as it should
be;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_13" id="Ref_13" href="#Foot_13">[13]</a></span> the
people have all the forms of freedom,
and the crown governs them while
they believe they govern themselves. Burleigh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
foresaw this, and said that to govern
<i>through</i> a parliament was the securest method
of exercising power.</p>

<p>In other places, where the number of
voters is something greater, so as to be too
many for this kind of quiet and absolute
control, the business is more difficult, and
sometimes more expensive. The candidate
then, instead of paying a settled sum to
the lord of the borough, must deal individually
with the constituents, who sell
themselves to the highest bidder. Remember
that an oath against bribery is
required! A common mode of evading
the letter of the oath is to lay a wager.
"I will bet so much," says the agent of
the candidate, "that you do not vote for
us." "Done," says the voter freeman,—goes
to the hustings, gives his voice, and
returns to receive the money, not as the
price of his suffrage, but as the bet which
he has won. As all this is in direct violation
of law, though both parties use the
same means, the losing one never scruples
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
to accuse his successful opponent of bribery,
if he thinks he can establish the
charge; and thus the mystery of iniquity
is brought to light. It is said that at
Aylesbury a punch-bowl full of guineas
stood upon the table in the committee-room,
and the voters were helped out of
it. The price of votes varies according
to their number. In some places it is as
low as forty shillings, in others, at Ilchester
for instance, it is thirty pounds. "Thirty
pounds," said the apothecary of the place
on his examination, "is the price of an
Ilchester voter." When he was asked how
he came to know the sum so accurately,
he replied, that he attended the families
of the voters professionally, and his bills
were paid at election times with the money.
A set of such constituents once waited
upon the member whom they had chosen,
to request that he would vote against the
minister. "D—mn you!" was his answer:
"What! have I not bought you? And do
you think I will not sell you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span></p>

<p>It is only in large cities that any trial of
public opinion is made,—for in the counties
the contest, if any there be, lies between
the great families, and a sort of hereditary
influence is maintained, which is perhaps
unobjectionable. But in large cities public
opinion and faction have their full scope.
Every resource of violence and of cunning
is here brought into play. A great proportion
of the inferior voters are necessarily
under the absolute control of their
employers; but there are always many who
are to be influenced by weighty arguments
applied to the palm of the hand; and the
struggle for these, when the parties happen
to be well balanced, leads to a thousand
devices. The moment one party can lay
hold on a voter of this description, they
endeavour to keep him constantly drunk
till the time of election, and never to lose
sight of him. If the others can catch him,
and overbid them, they, on their part, are
afraid of a rescue, carry their prize out of
town, and coop him in some barn or outhouse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
where they stuff him day and night
with meat and drink till they bring him up
to the place of polling, oftentimes so intoxicated
that the fellow must be led between
two others, one to hold him up as
he gives his voice, while the other shows
him a card in the palm of his hand, with
the name of the candidate written in large
letters, lest he should forget for whom he
is to vote.</p>

<p>The qualification for voting differs at
different places. At Bristol a freeman's
daughter conveys it by marriage. Women
enter into the heat of party even more
eagerly than men, and, when the mob is
more than usually mischievous, are sure to
be at the head of it. In one election for
that city, which was violently disputed, it
was common for the same woman to marry
several men. The mode of divorce was,
that as soon as the ceremony was over, and
the parties came out of church, they went
into the church-yard, and shaking hands
over a grave, cried, "Now death us do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
part;"—away then went the man to vote
with his new qualification, and the woman
to qualify another husband at another
church.</p>

<p>Such tricks are well understood, and
practised by all parties: but if an appeal
be made against a return as having been
thus obtained by illegal means, the cause
is tried in the house<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_14" id="Ref_14" href="#Foot_14">[14]</a></span> of commons, and
these are perhaps the only subjects which
are decided there with strict impartiality.
Bribery is punished in him who gives, by
the loss of his seat, and he may be prosecuted
for heavy fines: he who receives,
falls under the penal law—the heaviest punishment
ought to fall upon the tempter;
and as government in England is made a
trade, it seems hard that the poor should
not get something by it once in seven
years, when they are to pay so much for it
all the rest of the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
These abuses are not necessarily inherent
in the nature of popular election;
they would effectually be precluded by the
use of the ballot. The popular party call
loudly for reform, but they are divided
among themselves as to what reform they
would have; and the aristocracy of the
country, as they have every thing in their
own hands, will never consent to any
which would destroy their own influence.</p>

<p>One evil consequence results from this
mode of representation, which affects the
rulers as well as the people. The house
of commons has not, and cannot have, its
proportion of talents: its members are
wholly chosen from among persons of
great fortune. The more limited the number
out of which they are chosen, the less
must be the chance of finding able men:
there is, therefore, a natural unfitness in
having a legislative body composed wholly
of the rich. It is known both at schools
and at universities, that the students of
the privileged classes are generally remiss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
in their studies, and inferior in information
for that reason to their contemporaries;—there
is, therefore, less chance of finding
a due proportion of knowledge among
them. Being rich, and associating wholly
with the rich, they have no knowledge
of the real state of the great body for
whom they are to legislate, and little sympathy
for distresses which they have never
felt: a legislature composed wholly of the
rich, is therefore liable to lay the public
burthens oppressively upon the inferior
ranks.</p>

<p>There are two ways in which men of
talents, who are not men of fortune, find
their way into parliament. The minister
sometimes picks out a few promising
plants from the university, and forces
them in his hot-bed. They are chosen so
young that they cannot by any possibility
have acquired information to fit them for
their situations; they are so flattered by
the choice that they are puffed up with
conceit, and so fettered by it that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
must be at the beck of their patron. The
other method is by way of the law. But
men who make their way up by legal practice,
learn, in the course of that practice,
to disregard right and wrong, and to consider
themselves entirely as pleaders on the
one side. They continue to be pleaders
and partisans in the legislature, and never
become statesmen.</p>

<p>From these causes it is, that, while the
English people are held in admiration by
all the world, the English government is
regarded in so very different a light; and
hence it is, that the councils of England
have been directed by such a succession
of weak ministers, and marked by such a
series of political errors. An absolute monarch
looks for talents wherever they are
to be found, and the French negotiators
have always recovered whatever the English
fleets have won.</p>

<p>Long peace is not more unfavourable to
the skill of an army, than long security
to the wisdom of a government. In times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
of internal commotion, all stirring spirits
come forward; the whole intellect of a
nation is called forth; good men sacrifice
the comforts of a wise privacy to serve
their country; bad men press on to advance
themselves; the good fall a sacrifice,
and the government is resigned into the
hands of able villains. When, on the contrary,
every thing has long been safe, as is
the case in England, politics become an
established trade; to which a certain cast
are regularly born and bred. They are bred
to it as others are to the navy, to the law,
or to the church; with this wide difference,
that no predisposing aptitude of talents
has been consulted, and no study of
the profession is required. It is fine weather;
the ship is heavy laden; she has a
double and treble allowance of officers and
supernumeraries,—men enough on board,
but no seamen; still it is fine weather,
and as long as it continues so the ship
sails smoothly, and every thing goes on as
well as if Christopher Columbus himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
had the command. Changes are made in
the equipage; the doctor and the pilot take
each other's places; the gunner is made
cook, and the cook gunner; it may happen,
indeed, that he may charge the guns
with peas, and shot them with potatoes,—what
matters it while there is no enemy at
hand?</p>

<p>When J. was a school-boy every body
wore leathern breeches, which were made
so tight that it was a good half-hour's work
to get them on the first time. The maker
was obliged to assist at this operation:—observe,
this personage is not called a tailor,
but a maker of breeches,—tailors are
considered as an inferior class, and never
meddle with leather. When a gentleman
was in labour of a new pair of leathern
breeches, all his strength was required to
force himself into them, and all the assistant-operators
to draw them on: when
it was nearly accomplished, the maker
put his hands between the patient's legs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
closed them, and bade him sit on them like
a saddle, and kick out one leg at a time,
as if swimming. They could not be buttoned
without the help of an instrument.
Of course they fitted like another skin;
but woe to him who was caught in the
rain in them!—it was like plucking a skin
off to get out of them.</p>

<p>The shoes—I am not going back beyond
a score of years in any of these instances—were
made to a point in our unnatural
method; they were then rounded, then
squared, lastly made right and left like
gloves to fit the feet. At one time the
waistcoat was so long as to make the
wearer seem all body; at another time so
short that he was all limbs. The skirts of
the coat were now cut away so as almost to
leave all behind bare as a baboon, and now
brought forward to meet over the thigh
like a petticoat. Now the cape was laid flat
upon the shoulders, now it stood up straight
and stiff like an implement of torture,
now was rounded off like a cable. Formerly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
the half-boot was laced: the first
improvement was to draw it on like a
whole-boot; it was then discovered that
a band at the back was better than a seam,
and that a silken tassel in front would be
highly ornamental, and no doubt of essential
use. By this time the half-boot was
grown to the size of the whole one. The
Austrians, as they were called, yielded to
the Hessians, which, having the seams on
each side instead of down the back, were
more expensive, and therefore more fashionable.
Then came an invention for
wrinkling the leather upon the instep into
round folds, which were of singular utility
in retaining the dirt and baffling the shoeblack.
At length a superior genius having
arisen among boot-makers, the wheel went
completely round, and at this present
time every body must be seen in a pair of
whole-boots of this great man's making.</p>

<p>"Almost all new fashions offend me,"
says Feyjoo, "except those which either
circumscribe expense, or add to decency."—I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
am afraid that those reasons are practically
reversed in England, and that fashions
are followed with avidity in proportion
as they are extravagant and indecorous—to
use the lightest term. The most absurd
mode which I have yet heard of was
that of oiling the coat and cold-pressing
it; this gave it a high gloss, but every
particle of dust adhered to it, and after it
had been twice or thrice worn it was unfit
to be seen. This folly, which is but of
very late date, was too extravagant to last,
and never I believe extended into the
country. I asked my tailor one day, who
is a sensible man in his way, who invented
the fashions. "Why, sir," said he, "I
believe it is the young gentlemen who walk
in Bond-street. They come to me, and
give me orders for a new cut, and perhaps
it takes, and perhaps it does not. It is all
fancy, you know, sir." This street serves
as a Prado or Alameda for all the fops of
rank, and happy is he who gets the start in
a new cut; in the fall of a cape, the shape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
of a sleeve, or the pattern of a button.
This emulation produces many abortive
attempts, and it is amusing to see the
innovations which are daily hazarded
without ever attaining to the dignity of a
fashion.</p>

<p>Colour, as well as shape, is an affair of
fashionable legislation. Language is nowhere
so imperfect as in defining colours;
but if philosophical language be deficient
here, the creative genius of fashion is never
at a loss for terms. What think you of
the Emperor's eye, of the Mud of Paris,
and <i>Le soupir étouffé</i>,—the Sigh supprest?
These I presume were exotic flowers of
phraseology, imported for the use of the
ladies; it is however of as much importance
to man as to woman, that he should appear
in the prevailing colour. My tailor
tells me I must have pantaloons of a reddish
cast, "All on the reds now, sir!"
and reddish accordingly they are, in due
conformity to his prescription. It is even
regulated whether the coat shall be worn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
open or buttoned, and if buttoned, whether
by one button or two, and by which.
Sometimes a cane is to be carried in the
hand, sometimes a club, sometimes a common
twig; at present the more deformed
and crooked in its growth the better. At
one time every man walked the streets with
his hands in his coat pocket. The length
of the neck-handkerchief, the shape, the
mode of tying it, must all be in the mode.
There is a professor in the famous Bondstreet,
who, in lessons at half-a-guinea,
instructs gentlemen in the art of tying
their neck-handkerchiefs in the newest
and most approved style.</p>

<p>The women have been more extravagant
than the men;—to be more foolish was
impossible. Twenty years ago the smaller
the waist the more beautiful it was esteemed.
To be shaped like a wasp was therefore
the object of female ambition; and
so tight did they lace themselves, or rather
so tightly were they laced, for it required
assistant strength to fasten their girths,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
that women have frequently fainted from
the pressure, and some actually perished
by this monstrous kind of suicide. About
the same time they all wore powder; the
hair at the sides was stuck out in stiff curls,
or rolls, tier above tier, fastened with long
double black pins; behind it was matted
with pomatum into one broad flat mass,
which was doubled back and pinned upon
a cushion, against which the toupee was
frizzed up, and the whole frosted over
with powder, white, brown, pink, or yellow.
This was the golden age of hairdressers;
the ladies were completely dependent
upon them, and obliged to wait,
patiently or impatiently, for their turn.
On important occasions, when very many
were to be drest for the same spectacle,
it was not unusual to submit to the operation
over night, and sit up all night in
consequence,—for to have lain down
would have disordered the whole furniture
of the upper story. The great hoop,
which is now confined to the court, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
then commonly worn in private parties.
Besides this there were protuberances on
the hips called bustlers, another behind
which was called in plain language a rump,
and a merry-thought of wire on the breast
to puff out the handkerchief like a pouting
pigeon. Women were obliged to sip their
tea with the corner of their mouths, and
to eat sideways. A yet more extraordinary
costume succeeded, that of pads in front,
to imitate what it must have been originally
invented to conceal.</p>

<p>All these fashions went like the French
monarchy, and about the same time; but
when the ladies began to strip themselves,
they did not know where to stop.</p>

<p>And these follies travel where the science
and literature and domestic improvements
of the English never reach! Well does
Anguillesi say in his address to Fashion:</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">L</span><span class="smc">ady</span>
Mary Wortley Montagu, the best
letter-writer of this or of any other country,
has accounted for the extraordinary
facility with which her countrymen are
duped by the most ignorant quacks, very
truly and very ingeniously. "The English,"
she says, "are more easily infatuated
than any other people by the hope of
a panacea, nor is there any other country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
in the world where such great fortunes are
made by physicians. I attribute this to
the foolish credulity of mankind. As we
no longer trust in miracles and relics, we
run as eagerly after receipts and doctors,
and the money which was given three
centuries ago for the health of the soul, is
now given for the health of the body, by
the same sort of people, women and half-witted
men. Quacks are despised in
countries where they have shrines and
images."</p>

<p>How much to be lamented is the perversion
of a mind like hers, which, had it
not been heretical, would have been so
truly excellent! She perceives the truth;
but having been nursed up in a false religion,
and afterwards associated with persons
who had none, she does not perceive
the whole truth, and confounds light and
darkness. The foolish credulity of mankind!—To
be without faith and hope is
as unnatural a state for the heart as to be
without affections. Man is a credulous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
animal; perhaps he has never yet been
defined by a characteristic which more
peculiarly and exclusively designates him,
certainly never by a nobler one; for faith
and hope are what the heretics mean by
credulity. The fact is, as she states it.
Infidelity and heresy cannot destroy the
nature of man, but they pervert it; they
deprive him of his trust in God, and he
puts it in man; they take away the staff
of his support, and he leans upon a broken
reed.</p>

<p>In the worst sufferings and the most imminent
peril a true catholic never needs
despair; such is the power of the saints,
and the infinite mercy of God and the
most holy Mary: but the heretics in such
cases have only to despair and die. They
have no saint to look to for every particular
disease, no faith in relics to make
them whole. If a piece of the true cross
were brought to a dying Englishman,
though its efficacy had been proved by a
thousand miracles, he would reject it even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
at the last gasp; such is the pride and obstinacy
of heresy, and so completely does
it harden the heart.</p>

<p>There are a thousand facts to verify the
remark of Lady Wortley. The boasted
knowledge of England has not sunk deep;
it is like the golden surface of a lackered
watch, which covers, and but barely covers,
the base metal. The great mass of
the people are as ignorant, and as well
contented with their ignorance, as any the
most illiterate nation in Europe: and even
among those who might be expected to
know better, it is astonishing how slowly
information makes way to any practical
utility. In domestic medicine for instance;—a
defluxion is here called a cold,
and therefore for its name's sake must be
expelled by heat. Oil is employed to
soften a hard cough, and lemon juice to
cut it; because in English sourness is
synonymous with sharpness, and what is
sharp must needs cut. But it is of superstition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
that I am to speak, and perverted
credulity.</p>

<p>The abracadabra of the old heretics was
lately in use as a charm for the ague, and
probably still is where the ague is to be
found, for that disease has almost wholly
disappeared within the last generation.
For warts there are manifold charms. The
person who wishes to be rid of them takes
a stick, and cuts a notch in it for every
wart, and buries it, and as it rots the warts
are to decay. Or he steals a piece of beef
and rubs over them, and buries it in like
manner. Or stealing dry peas or beans, and
wrapping them up, one for each wart, he
carries the parcel to a place where four
roads meet, and tosses it over his head,
not looking behind to see where it falls;
he will lose the warts, and whoever picks
it up will have them. But there are gifted
old women who have only to slip a thread
over these excrescencies, or touch them
with their saliva, and they dry away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
It is a truth, that we have but too many
such superstitious follies; with us, however,
there is always some mixture of devotion
in them, and the error, though it be an
error, and as such deservedly discouraged,
is at least pious. He who psalms a sick
man, or fancies that the oil from his
saint's lamp will heal him of all his complaints,
errs on the safe side. Here none
of these palliations are to be found; the
practices have not merely no reference to
religion, but have even the characters of
witchcraft. The materials for the charm
must be stolen to render them efficacious,
secrecy is enjoined, and it is supposed
that the evil is only to be got rid of by
transferring it to another. In Catholic
countries the confessor commands the
thief to make restitution,—here the person
who has been robbed repairs to a witch or
wizard to recover the loss, or learn who
the criminal is, by means of a familiar
spirit! A Cunning-Man, or a Cunning-Woman,
as they are termed, is to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
found near every town, and though the
laws are occasionally put in force against
them, still it is a gainful trade. This it is
to deprive credulity of its proper food.</p>

<p>None suffer so severely from this as
they who are labouring under diseases;
if money is to be gotten, such is the spirit
of trade, neither the dying nor the
dead are spared, and quackery is carried to
greater perfection of villainy here than in
any other part of the world. Sickness
humbles the pride of man; it forces upon
him a sense of his own weakness, and
teaches him to feel his dependence upon
unseen Powers: that therefore which
makes wise men devout, makes the ignorant
superstitious. Among savages the
physician and the conjurer are always the
same. The operations of sickness and
of healing are alike mysterious, and hence
arises the predilection of many enthusiasts
for quackery, and the ostentation which
all quacks make of religion, or of some
extraordinary power in themselves. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
favourite assertion formerly in all countries
was, that of an innate gift as a
seventh son, I know not on what superstition
founded, and of course augmented
seven fold in due proportion, if
the father had been a seventh son also, or
even the mother a seventh daughter, for in
this case there is no Salic law. Another has
claimed the same privilege because he was
born deaf and dumb, as if nature had thus
indemnified him for the faculties of which
he was deprived. The kings of England
long since the schism, though the practice
is now disused, have touched for the
evil, and used to appoint a day in the
Gazette for publicly doing it. Where
this divine property has not been ascribed
to the physician it has been imputed to
the medicine. The most notorious of
these worthies who flourishes at present
calls his composition the Cordial Balm of
Gilead, and prefaces every advertisement
with a text from Jeremiah, "Is there no
Balm in Gilead? is there no physician
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
there? why then is not the health of the
daughter of my people recovered?"—Thus
the Arabs attribute the virtue of their balm
to the blood of those who were slain at
Beder. We see among ourselves but too
many scandalous proofs of this weakness.
A Cistercian historian assures us that he
was cured of an obstinate illness by taking
a pill of the earth of the pit in which God
made Adam: and at this day the rinsings
of the cup are eagerly sought after by the
sick, notwithstanding the prohibition of
the church.</p>

<p>Perhaps we are indebted to the Jews for
the vulgar feeling of the divine origin of
the healing art. They will have it that
Adam had an intuitive knowledge of medicine,
and that Solomon's Book of Trees<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_15" id="Ref_15" href="#Foot_15">[15]</a></span>
and Herbs was written by inspiration. The
founder of the Quakers was in danger of
taking to the practice of physic from a similar
notion. He fancied that he was in
the same state as Adam before the fall, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
that the nature and virtues of all things
were opened to him, and he was at a stand,
as he says, whether he should practise physic
for the good of mankind.</p>

<p>Wesley went beyond him, and published
what he called Primitive Physic, fancying
himself chosen to restore medicine as well
as religion, and to prescribe both for body
and soul, like St Luke. The greater number
of his remedies are old women's receipts,
neither good nor ill; but others are
of a more desperate nature. For a cold in
the head he directs you to pare an orange
very thin, roll it up inside out, and put a
plug in each nostril; for the wind colic,
to eat parched peas; for the gout, to apply
a raw beef-steak to the part affected; for
raving madness, to set the patient with his
head under a great waterfall as long as his
strength will bear it; and for asthma and
hypochondriasis, to take an ounce of quicksilver
every morning! If all his prescriptions
had been like this last, his book
might have been entitled, after the favourite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
form of the English, Every Man his own
Poisoner. In general they are sufficiently
innocent; which is fortunate, for I have
selected these instances from the twenty-first
edition of his work, and no doubt
the purchasers place in it implicit confidence.</p>

<p>Any scientific discovery is immediately
seized by some of the numerous adventurers
in this country, who prey upon the follies
and the miseries of their fellow-creatures.
The most eminent quack of the last generation
was a Doctor Graham, who tampered
with electricity in a manner too infamous to
be reported, and for which he ought to have
received the most exemplary public punishment.
This man was half mad, and his madness
at last, contrary to the usual process,
got the better of his knavery. His latest
method of practice was something violent;
it was to bury his patients up to the chin in
fresh mould. J. saw half a score of them
exhibited in this manner for a shilling:—a
part of the exhibition was to see them perform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
afterwards upon shoulders of mutton,
to prove that when they rose from the grave
they were as devouring as the grave itself.
The operation lasted four hours: they suffered,
as might be seen in their countenances,
intensely from cold for the first
two, during the third they grew warmer,
and in the last perspired profusely, so that
when they were taken out the mould reeked
like a new dunghill. Sailors are said to
have practised this mode of cure successfully
for the scurvy. The doctor used
sometimes to be buried himself for the
sake of keeping his patients company: one
day, when he was in this condition, a
farmer emptied a watering-pot upon his
head to make him grow. When J. saw him
he was sitting up to the neck in a bath of
warm mud, with his hair powdered and in
full dress. As he was haranguing upon the
excellent state of health which he enjoyed
from the practice of earth-bathing, as he
called it, J. asked him, Why then, if there
was nothing the matter with him, he sate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
in the mud? The question puzzled him.—Why,
he said,—why—it was—it was—it
was to show people that it did no harm,—that
it was quite innocent,—that it was
very agreeable: and then brightening his
countenance with a smile at the happiness
of the thought, he added, "It gives me,
sir, a skin as soft as the feathers of Venus'
dove." This man lived upon vegetables,
and delighted in declaiming against the
sin of being carnivorous, and the dreadful
effects of making the stomach a grave and
charnel-house for slaughtered bodies. Latterly
he became wholly an enthusiast,
would madden himself with ether, run out
into the streets, and strip himself to clothe
the first beggar whom he met.</p>

<p>Galvanism, like electricity, was no sooner
discovered than it was applied to purposes
of quackery. The credit of this is
due to America; and it must be admitted
that the inventor has the honour of having
levied a heavier tax upon credulity
than any of his predecessors ever dared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
attempt: in this respect he is the Mr
Pitt of his profession. For two pieces of
base metal, not longer than the little finger,
and not larger than a nail, he is modest
enough to charge five guineas. These
Tractors, as they are called, are to cure all
sores, swellings, burns, tooth-ache, &amp;c.
&amp;c.: and that the purchasers may beware
of counterfeits, which is the advice always
given by this worshipful fraternity, a portrait
of the tractor is engraved upon his
hand-bills, both a front view and a back
one, accompanied with a striking likeness
of the leathern case in which they are contained.
Many cures have certainly been
performed by them, and how those cures
are performed has been as certainly exemplified
by some very ingenious experiments
which were made at Bath and Bristol.
Pieces of wood, and others of common
iron, shaped and coloured like the tractors,
were tried there upon some paralytic
patients in the Infirmary. The mode of
operating consists in nothing more than in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
gently stroking the part affected with the
point of the instrument, and so, according
to the theory, conducting off into the
atmosphere the galvanic matter of pain!
It is impossible that where there is no
sore, this can give any pain whatever,—yet
the patients were in agonies. One of
them declared that he had suffered less
when pieces of the bone of his leg had
been cut out,—and they were actually enabled
to move limbs which before were dead
with palsy.—False relics have wrought
true miracles.</p>

<p>Another gentleman quacks with oxygen,
and recommends what he calls vital wine
as a cure for all diseases. Vital wine must
be admitted to be something extraordinary;
but what is that to a people for whom
solar and lunar tinctures have been prepared!
Another has risen from a travelling
cart to the luxuries of a chariot by selling
magnetic girdles; his theory is, that the
magnetic virtue attracts the iron in the
blood, and makes the little red globules
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
revolve faster, each upon its own axis, in
the rapidity and regularity of which revolutions
health consists,—and this he proves
to the people by showing them how a
needle is set in motion by his girdles. But
magnetism has been made the basis of a
far more portentous quackery, which is in
all its parts so extraordinary that it merits
a full account, not merely in a Picture of
England, but also in the history of the
century which has just expired. My next
shall develop this at length.</p>

<p>The reason why these scoundrels succeed
to so much greater an extent in England
than in any other country, is because they
are enabled to make themselves so generally
known by means of the newspapers,
and, in consequence of the great internal
commerce, to have their agents every
where, and thus do as much mischief every
where, as if the Devil had endowed them
with a portion of his own ubiquity. Not
only do the London papers find their way
over the whole kingdom, but every considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
town in the provinces has one or
more of its own, and in these they insert
their long advertisements with an endless
perseverance which must attract notice,
and make them and their medicines talked
of. How effectually this may be done, I
can illustrate by an odd anecdote. Some
twelve or fifteen years ago a wager was
laid between two persons in London, that
the one would, in the course of a few
weeks, make any nonsensical word, which
the other should choose to invent, a general
subject of conversation. Accordingly
he employed people to write in chalk upon
all the walls in London the word <i>Quoz</i>.
Every body saw this word wherever they
went staring them in the face, and nobody
could divine its meaning. The newspapers
noticed it,—What can it be? was the general
cry, and the man won his wager.</p>

<p>Upon this system the quacks persist in
advertising at an enormous expense, for
which, however, they receive ample interest,—and
which indeed they do not always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
honestly pay. Part of their scheme is to
advertise in newspapers which are newly
set up, and which, therefore, insert their
notices at an under price; and one fellow,
when he was applied to for payment,
refused, saying that his clerk had ordered
the insertion without his knowledge. To
go to law with him would have been a remedy
worse than the disease.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">is true here as well as in other countries.</p>

<p>These wretches know the sufferings and
the hopes of mankind, and they mock the
one and aggravate the other. They who
suffer, listen gladly to any thing which
promises relief; and these men insert
such cases of miraculous cures, signed and
sworn to and attested, that they who do
not understand how often the recovery
may be real and the cure imaginary,—the
fact true and the application false,—yield
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
to the weight of human testimony, and
have faith to the destruction of their bodies,
though they will have none to the salvation
of their souls.</p>

<p>Attestations to these cases are procured
in many ways. A quack of the first water
for a long time sent his prescriptions to the
shop of some druggists of great respectability.
After some months he called there
in his carriage, and introduced himself,
saying that they must often have seen his
name, and that he now came to complain
of them, for unintentionally doing him
very serious mischief. "Gentlemen," said
he, "you charge your drugs too low. As
medical men yourselves you <i>must</i> know
how much depends upon faith, and people
have no faith in what is cheap,—they
will not believe that any thing can do them
good unless they pay smartly for it. I
must beg you to raise your prices, and
raise them high too, double and treble
what they now are at least,—or I really
must send my patients elsewhere." This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
was strange, and what they were requested
to do was not after the ordinary custom
of fair trading;—but as it did not appear
that there could be any other advantage
resulting to him from it than what he had
stated, they at last promised to do as he
desired. This visit led to some further
acquaintance; and after another long interval,
they were persuaded one day to dine
with their friend the Doctor. During
dinner the servant announced that a person
from the country wished to see the Doctor,
and thank him for having cured him.
"Oh," said he, "don't you know that
I am engaged? These people wear me out
of my very life! Give the good man something
to eat and drink, tell him I am very
glad he is got well, and send him away."
The servant came in again,—"Sir, he will
not go,—he says it is a most wonderful
cure,—that you have raised him from the
dead, and he cannot be happy till he has
seen you and thanked you himself. He
is come a long way from the country, sir."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
"Gentlemen," said the Doctor, "you
see how it is. I do not know how to get
rid of him, unless you will have the goodness
to allow him just to come in, and
then he will be satisfied and let us alone.
This is the way I am plagued!" In
came the countryman, and began to bless
the Doctor, as the means under God, of
snatching him from the grave; and offered
him money tied up in a leathern bag,
saying it was all the compensation he could
make; but if it were ten times as much it
would be too little,—the Doctor crying,
"Well, well, my friend, I am glad to see
you so well," and refusing to take his
money. Still the man persisted, and
would tell the company his case,—he
could not in conscience be easy if he did
not,—and he began a long story, which
the Doctor first attempted to stop, and then
affected not to listen to,—till at length, by
little and little, he began to give ear to it,
and seemed greatly interested before he
had done, and interrupted him with questions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
At last he called for pen and ink,
saying—"This is so very extraordinary a
case that I must not lose it;" and making
the man repeat it as he wrote, frequently
said to his visitors, "Gentlemen, I beg you
will take notice of this,—it is a very remarkable
case:" and when he had finished
writing it, he said to them, "You have
heard the good man's story, and I am sure
can have no objection to subscribe your
names as witnesses." The trick was apparent,
and they begged leave to decline appearing
upon the occasion. "Why, gentlemen,"
said he, "you and I had better continue
friends. You must be sensible that I
have been the means of putting very great
and unusual profits into your hands, and
you will not surely refuse me so trifling a
return as that of attesting a case which you
have heard from the man himself, and can
have no doubt about!" There was no remedy:
they were caught, felt themselves
in his power, and were obliged to submit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
to the mortification of seeing themselves
advertised as witnesses to a cure which
they knew to be a juggle.</p>

<p>This same man once practised a similar
trick in such a way that the wit almost
atones for the roguery. Some young men
of fashion thought it would be a good
joke to get him to dinner and make him
drunk, and one of them invited him for
this purpose. The Doctor went, and left
his friend the countryman to follow him,
and find him out;—of course it was still
better sport for them to hear the case.
But the next morning it appeared in the
newspapers with the names of the whole
party to attest it.</p>

<p>Government gives an indirect sort of
sanction to these worst of all impostors.
They enter the receipt of their medicines
as a discovery, and for the payment of
about 100<i>l.</i> sterling, take out a privilege,
which is here called a patent, prohibiting
all other persons from compounding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
same; then they announce their discoveries
as by the king's authority, and thus
the ignorant are deceived. The Scotch<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_17" id="Ref_17" href="#Foot_17">[17]</a></span>
Universities also sell them degrees in medicine
without the slightest examination,—this
trade in degrees being their main support,—and
they are legally as true Doctors
in medicine as the best of the profession.
This infamous practice might soon be put
a stop to. Their medicines may be classed
under three heads; they are either such
as can do no good, but produce immediate
exhilaration, because they contain
either laudanum or spirits; or they are
well-known drugs given in stronger doses
than usual, so as to be sure of producing
immediate good at the probable chance of
occasioning after mischief; or they are
more rarely new medicines, introduced
before the regular practitioners will venture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
to employ them. In this way arsenic
was first employed. The famous fever
powder of Dr James is of this description;
he knew it would be adopted in
general practice, and, to secure the profits
to his representatives after the term of his
privilege should have expired, had recourse
to means which cannot be justified. Every
person upon taking out a patent is obliged
to specify upon oath the particular discovery
on which he grounds his claim to it.
He entered a false receipt: so that, though
the ingredients have been since detected
by analysis, still the exact proportions and
the method of preparation are supposed to
be known only to those who have succeeded
to his rights, and who in consequence
still derive an ample income from the success
of this artifice.</p>

<p>There is yet another mystery of iniquity
to be revealed. Some of the rascals who
practise much in a particular branch of
their art are connected with gamblers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
They get intimate with their young moneyed
patients, and as they keep splendid
houses, invite them to grand entertainments,
where part of the gang are ready
to meet them, and when the wine is done
with the dice are produced.</p>

<p>According to this new system of physics,
the earth, its atmosphere, and all
their productions are only one, and each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
is but a separate portion of the whole, accasionally
produced and received back into
itself, for the purpose of maintaining a
continual and regular rotation of animate
and inanimate substances. An universal
connection subsists between every particle
and mass of particles of this whole,
whether they be comprehended under
the title of solids or fluids, or distinguished
by the particular appellation of
men, beasts, birds, fish, trees, plants, or
herbs; all are particles of the same original
mass, and are in perpetual cycle employed
in the work of forming, feeding, decomposing,
and again re-forming bodies
or masses. A regular attachment universally
exists between all particles of a similar
nature throughout the whole; and
all forms composed in and of any medium
of particles, must be influenced by whatever
affects that medium, or sets its particles
in motion; so that every form in the
earth and atmosphere must receive and
partake of every impulse received by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
general medium of atoms in which and of
which they are formed.</p>

<p>All forms are subject to one general
law; action and re-action produce heat,
some of their constituent atoms are rendered
fluid by heat, and form streams, and
convey into the form atoms for its increase
and nourishment; this is called composition
by vegetation and circulation. Circulation
not only brings in particles for
growth and nourishment, but it also carries
off the useless ones. The passages
through which these particles pass in and
out, are called pores. By a pore we are
to understand a space formed between
every two solid atoms in the whole vegetating
world, by the liquefaction of the
atom, which, when solid, filled up that
space. As circulation, vegetation, and
consequently animal life, arise from the
formation of pores, so the destruction of
them must terminate every process of animal
existence, and each partial derangement
of porosity induces incipient destruction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
of the form, or what is called
disease.</p>

<p>By the process of circulation atoms of
various kinds are carried in, deposited,
and thrown out of each part of every form;
and every form is surrounded and protected
by an atmosphere peculiar to itself,
composed of these particles of circulating
fluids, and analogous to the general atmosphere
of the earth. This is the general atmosphere
of the form. The solid parts
of the body throw off in the same manner
their useless particles, but these pass off
and become blended with those of the
general atmosphere of the earth. These
are called the emanations of the form.
Thus, then, earth and atmosphere are one
whole, of which every form is but a part;
the whole and all its parts are subject
to the same laws, and are supported by
action; action produces re-action; action
and re-action produce heat; heat produces
fluidity; fluidity produces pores; pores
produce circulation; circulation produces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
vegetation; vegetation produces forms;
forms are composed of solids and fluids;
solids produce emanations; fluids produce
atmospheres; atmospheres and emanations
produce partial decomposition; total decomposition
is death; death and decomposition
return the atoms to the general
mass for re-production.</p>

<p>The whole vegetating system is comprised
in miniature in man. He is composed
of pipes beyond conception numerous,
and formed of particles between
which the most minute porosity admits,
in every direction, the passage of atoms
and fluids. The immense quantity of air
which is continually passing in and out
through every part and pore of the body,
carries in with it such atoms as may become
mixed with the general atmosphere,
and these must either pass out again, or
stop in their passage. If they should be
of a hurtful nature, they injure the parts
through which they pass, or in which
they stop; if, on the contrary, they should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
be healthy and natural, they contribute
to health and nourishment. Butchers,
publicans, cooks, living in an atmosphere
of nutritious substances, generally become
corpulent, though they have slender appetites;
painters, plumbers, dyers, and those
who are employed in atmospheres of pernicious
substances, become gradually diseased,
and frequently lose the use of their
limbs long before decomposition takes
place for their relief.</p>

<p>Hence it appears that the free circulation
of healthy atoms through the whole
form is necessary, and that obstructions
of its porosity, or stoppage of its circulating
particles, must occasion derangement
in the system, and be followed by disease.
To obviate this evil, innumerable conductors
are placed in the body, adapted,
by their extreme sensibility, to convey information
of every impression to the sensorium;
which, according to the nature of
the impression, or the injury received,
agitates, shakes, or contracts the form to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
thrust forth the offending cause. This is
Nature's established mode of cure, and the
efficacy of the exertion depends on the
strength of the system; but these salutary
efforts have been mistaken for disease.</p>

<p>As every impression is received through
one medium, disposed over the whole
form for that purpose, it may be asserted
that there is but one sense, and that all
these impressions are only divisions of
the sense of feeling. The accuracy of
any of these divisions depends on the
health of the nervous system in general.—This
nervous or conducting system is only
a portion of a much greater one, similar
in its nature, but far more extensive in its
employment.</p>

<p>There are in the general atmosphere
innumerable strings of its component
atoms; the business of these strings is
to receive and convey, from and through
every part of the atmosphere, of the earth
and of their inhabitants, whatever impulses
they receive. These conductors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
are to be called atmospherical nerves;
the nerves of the human body are connected
with these, or rather are a part of
them.</p>

<p>This is elucidated by the phænomena
of sound. Theorists agree that sound is
produced in a bell by the tremulous motion
of its component atoms, which alternately
changes its shape from round to
oval a million times in one instant; as is
proved by horizontally introducing a bar
into the aperture, which, counteracting
one of the contractions, the bell splits.—The
conveyance of sound they account
for by saying that the atoms of the atmosphere
are displaced by the alternate contractions
of the bell. Place a lighted candle
near the bell, and this theory is overthrown:
if the general atmosphere is agitated,
wind must result, but the flame of
the candle remains steady. Let us substitute
the true process.</p>

<p>Every impression in nature has its own
peculiar set of conductors, and no two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
sets interfere with, or impede, each other.
The stroke of the bell affects the nearest
atom of the nerves of sound, and runs
along them in every direction. Human
nerves are continuations of the atmospherical;
all animated beings being only as
warts or excrescences which have sprung
up amidst these atmospherical nerves, and
are permeated by them in every direction.
The atmospherical nerves of sound are
parts of the auditory nerves in man; the
atmospherical nerves of light are continued
through man to form his optic nerves; and
thus the auditory and optic nerves of one
man are the auditory and optic nerves of
every animated being in the universe, because
all are branches sent off from the
same great tree in the parent earth and atmosphere.</p>

<p>It may be asked, What prevents the
derangement of these innumerable strings
when the atmosphere is violently agitated?
Aërial nerves are like those of animated
bodies, composed of atoms, but the atoms
are in loose contact. When a ray of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
sunshine comes through the hole in a window-shutter
the atoms are visible, and the
hand may pass through them, but they instantly
resume their situations by their attractive
connection.</p>

<p>Every inanimate substance is attached
to its similar; all animate and inanimate
substances are attached to each other by
every similar part in each of their compositions;
all animate beings are attached
to each other by every similar atom in
their respective forms, and all these attachments
are formed by atmospherical
nerves. If two musical instruments perfectly
in unison be placed one at each end
of the same apartment, whatever note is
struck upon the one will be repeated by
the other. Martial music may be heard
by a whole army in the field; each note
has its peculiar conductor in the general
atmosphere, and each ear must be connected
with the atmospherical conductor
of each note; so that every note has not
only its separate conductor in the atmosphere,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
but also its separate conductor in
every ear.—We have got through the hypothesis,
now to the application.</p>

<p>The mind is the arbitrator over the
bones, the muscles, the nerves, and the
body in general, and is that something
which the anatomist's knife can neither
dissect, discover, nor destroy. But to
define what that something is, we must
apply to the words of our Saviour,—"It is
not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your
Father which speaketh in you." The decisions,
adoptions, and commands of this
spirit are man's volition; but we are not
accustomed to investigate the means by
which volition is exerted, nor to seek for
the privilege of improving it beyond the
common necessary avocations of life. Yet,
if it be properly sought for, a power of
volition may be called forth in man, in a
far more exalted degree than what he now
exerts; a power subordinate to a far superior
one, by whom it is portioned out to
individuals according to the purposes for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
which they exert it, and which is partially
or totally recalled when neglected or abused.
The accomplishment of any purpose
of the will depends physically on the length
of time required for its performance, and
on the undisturbed continuance of the act
of volition during that time. The least
interruption, or the change of the will to
any other subject before the first intention
is accomplished, totally destroys the influence.
This axiom is unalterable in this
new science of healing, that to produce
salutary effects the suggestion must be pure
and moral, the attention steadily determined,
the intention single and fixed, and
volition vigorously exerted, continuing unvaried
and unrelaxed either till the purpose
is effected or relinquished.</p>

<p>On the pretensions to inspiration which
are implied here I shall remark elsewhere,
nor will I interrupt the account with any
comments upon the impudent hypocrisy
with which it is seasoned to the public
taste. To proceed then;—the atmospherical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
part of the human body is capable of
contraction, of distention, and of direction;
it may be attracted from, or distended
to, any unlimited distance, and may be
so directed as to penetrate any other form
in nature.</p>

<p>The rejected atoms from the fluid, and
emanations from the solid parts of bodies,
when rightly understood, are the only and
unerring criterion by which the obstructions
and diseases of each part can be ascertained,
and when judiciously employed
they become material instruments for the
removal of every malady. They are subject
to the influence of volition, and may
be forced out of their natural course, or
attracted into the pores of the operator;
and the human body, which in many respects
resembles a sponge, is adapted to
receive such emanations and atmospheres
as a skilful practitioner may propel into
any part of it, and to afford them a free
passage wherever he directs them. The
countless number of universal nerves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
which combine with, and are regular continuations
of, those similar conductors
called nerves in animal forms, are subject
to the influence of man's spiritual volition,
and are affected or influenced if we strike
one or more of them with the atoms which
are continually flowing from us; that
affection is conveyed on to such parts of
the body as those conductors are attached
to, and the nature and degree of the impulse
will be according to the nature of the
intention and the energy of the volition.</p>

<p>To determine the situation, nature, and
extent of derangement or disease, recourse
must be had to the atoms which proceed
from the patient, for the rejected atoms
resemble in their healthy or diseased qualities
the parts from which they pass.
These particles of matter are so immediately
subject to the influence of combined
spiritual volition, that the established
system by which they are mixed with the
universal medium gives way during our
exertion, and they follow the course which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">{318}</a></span>
we prescribe; and whatever may be the
direction or medium through which we
propel them, they remain unalterably the
same, and continue passive and unchanged
either by distance, direction, or contact,
until we withdraw that influence, and
discharge them from our service.</p>

<p>To judge of the state of the part from
whence these atoms proceed, they must
be attracted to some part of the examiner's
body, and must strike his nerves; this
process is called receiving impressions or
sensations from the patient. Every substance
in nature will afford some impression
to that part of his body which the
experienced examiner opposes to receive
it, but professors usually prefer the hands
and especially the fingers. The roots of the
nails most commonly announce the first
impressions, because the cuticle is thinnest
in that part, and the pungent emanations
more readily arrive at the nerves. No
part perhaps of this astonishing science,
says the lecturer, creates more jealousy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
among students than their susceptibility
of sensations. Some enjoy that privilege
to a great degree of accuracy even at the
first essay, whilst others are in pursuit of
it for months. This difference is at
first constitutional; but when the science
has produced a proper influence on the
mind and morals, the impressions insensibly
grow into accuracy. It sometimes
happens that they who were most susceptible
at first become totally deprived of
that blessing until they approve themselves
more worthy servants. It is essentially necessary
to render the process of receiving
the atoms emitted from every object familiar;
this will be effected by habitually
seeking for them. For this purpose students
should frequently receive the emanations
from salt, sugar, water, fire, and
in short from every substance which occurs;
by this means they soon become
expert.</p>

<p>There are two modes of Examination;
the first is that which should accurately be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
attended to by newly initiated students,
as it affords a catalogue of sensations which
become a regular standard to judge of all
diseases by, and to reduce examination to
accuracy and perfection. This mode consists
in opposing one or both hands towards
the patient. The examiner should sit or
stand in an easy position, cautiously avoiding
all pressure on his body or arms, lest
he should suspect the impressions to proceed
from that cause rather than from the
disease. He should fix on some particular
part of the patient, external or internal;
then turning the backs of his hands, he
must vigorously and steadily command
the emanations and atmosphere which pass
from that part to strike his hands, and he
must closely attend to whatever impressions
are produced on them. He must not
permit his attention to wander from the
object: if he should, his labour is entirely
lost. To render the process more steady,
the eyes of the examiner should be fixed
on the part to which he is attending, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></span>
the unvaried intent of directing the effluent
atoms towards his hands; it might naturally
be supposed that his eyes should be
open, but is better they were shut, as all
extraneous objects are by that means excluded,
and the porosity of the eyelids
removes the idea of impediment. It is
perfectly immaterial what may be the distance
between the examiner and the patient:
the process and the impressions will
be exactly the same, provided he calls
forth in himself the requisite exertion.</p>

<p>The second mode of examination is by
opposing the whole body to that of the
patient. In this the operator must not
seek to know where the patient is, but
recollecting that all human beings are
connected to each other by innumerable
atmospherical nerves, and that the whole
medium in which they are placed is composed
of loose atoms, he must fix his attention
upon the patient, as if he stood
before him. Thus situated, he must vigorously
exert his power to attract all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
emanations and atmospheres proceeding
from the patient to himself. The atoms,
then, which proceed from each particular
part of the patient run to the same parts
of the examiner, who feels in every part of
his own person whatever the patient feels
in his, only in a less degree, but always
sufficiently to enable him to describe the
feelings of the patient, and to ascertain
the very spot in which the derangement
exists, and the consequences resulting
from it. If the examiner's attention is
directed only to one particular viscus, that
same viscus alone will receive information
in himself; but if it be generally directed,
every part of his body will give an account
of its own proceedings. It is to be remarked
that undiseased parts will not
convey any remarkable impression to the
examiner, as nothing results from health
but gentle, soft, equable heat.</p>

<p>The mode of healing is termed Treating;—it
is a process made use of by the operator
to create, if partially obliterated, or to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
increase, if become languid, the natural
action and re-action in any part of the
body; and to assist nature by imitating
and re-establishing her own law, when she
is become inadequate to the task. This
process is the opposite to the last; in that
the examiner attracted the atoms from the
patient to himself, but in this he must
propel the atoms from himself to the patient.
By a steady exertion of compound
volition we have it in our power to propel
the particles which emanate from our own
body, against and into whatever part of
any other form we fix our intention upon,
and can force them in any direction and
to any distance. Thus, by a continual and
regular succession of particles directed
vigorously in a rapid stream against those
atoms which are stopt in their passage and
accumulated into a heap, we break down
the impediments, push off those atoms
which we detach, direct them into the
circulating currents for evacuation, and
save the system from all the evil consequences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
which its impeded functions were
occasioning. This is like throwing handfuls
of shot at a heap of sand in a rivulet,
which, as the grains of sand are separated
from each other, washes them along before
it. As all obstructions are not equally
hard or compact, they are not all destroyed
with the same facility. A single look will
often prove sufficient for a recent accumulation
of particles, for an accidental contraction,
or a sudden distention, whereas
those of long standing and of a more serious
nature demand frequent, long, and
judiciously-varied treatment.</p>

<p>The general process of treatment is an
influence of mind over organized matter,
in which unorganized matter is the occasional
instrument. The mind should be
able to perform this work without any
particular motions of the body, or of its
extremities. But, says the professor, inexperience,
and the frequent disturbances
which occur to divert the attention, induce
us to adopt some mode of action, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
constant repetition of which may attract,
rouse, or recall the mind to its subject,
when it becomes languid, or diverted from
its employment. Hence, he adds, we
generally employ our hands in the act of
treating, and write, as it were, our various
intentions on each part by the motions we
make towards it: or, in fact, we trace on
the diseased part with our current of emanations
the various curative intentions of
our mind or spirit.</p>

<p>The Pathology is soon explained. The
impressions produced upon the fingers of
the examiner by the stone will be heaviness,
indolence, and cold. Burns and scalds
produce heavy dull pricking at first, when
inflammation has taken place great heat
and sharp pricking, but indolent numbness
from the centre. Rheumatic headache
occasions pricking, numbness, and
creeping or vermicular motion, heat if the
patient be strong, cold if he be relaxed.
Inflammation caused by confined wind produces
intense heat, pricking and creeping;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>
the heat is occasioned by the inflammation,
the pricking by the wind acting
against the obstructed pores, and the creeping
by the motion of the wind from one
part to another. Pus communicates to
the hand of the examiner such a feeling
of softness as we should expect from dipping
the hand in it, but combined with
pricking from the motion which the wind
contained in it makes in its endeavours
to escape. Diseased lungs make the fingers
feel as if dough had been permitted to
dry on them, this is called clumsy stiffness.
Pleurisy occasions creeping, heat and pricking;
deafness, resistance and numbness.
Contracted nerves announce themselves to
the examiner by a pressure round his fingers,
as if a string was tightly bound round
them; cases of relaxed habit by a lengthened
debilitated sensation; diseased spleen,
or ovaries, by a spinning in the fingers'
ends, as if something were twirling about
in them. The impression which scrofula
produces upon the practitioner is curious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
and extraordinary: at every motion which
he makes, the joints of his fingers, wrists,
elbows, and shoulders crack. Worms excite
creeping and pinching; bruises, heaviness
in the hands, and numbness of the
fingers.</p>

<p>The Modus Operandi must now be
exemplified, premising, according to the
professor's words, that the operator's own
emanations become for him invisible fingers,
which penetrate the pores, and are
to be considered as the natural and only
ingredients which are or can be adapted
to the removal of nervous, or of any other
affections of the body.</p>

<p>Instead therefore of lithotomy, the stone
may thus be cured without danger or pain.
This invisible power must be applied to
the juices which circulate in the vicinity
of the stone: and they must be conducted
to the stone and applied to its surface,
that the stone may be soaked in them for
the purpose of dissolving the gum which
makes the particles of sand cohere. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">{328}</a></span>
the hands are employed in this process,
the mind must conceive that the streams
of atoms which continually rush forth
from the fingers, are continued on, and
lengthened out into long invisible fingers
which become continuations of our natural
ones; and which, being composed of
minute particles, are perfectly adapted to
pass through the pores of another form,
and to be applied, as we should apply our
visible fingers, to the very part on which
it is intended to act. The last process is
Action: by striking those very emanating
particles that constitute that invisible elongation
of the part of our own body which
it is intended to employ, whether it be
the hand, the eye, or any other part,—by
striking them forcibly in constant and
rapid succession against the stone, the particles
of sand, having been rendered less
tenacious by the soaking, loosen, and fall
apart, and are washed out of the body by
the natural evacuation.</p>

<p>One instance more will suffice. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>
cases of indigestion the sensations produced
by the ropy humour in the stomach are
a thick gummy feel on the fingers; and
when they are gently moved they meet
with a slight degree of resistance. To
judge of the depth of this slimy humour
the fingers must be perpendicularly dipt
in it to the bottom of the stomach; the
consequence will be the impression of a
circular line as if a string surrounded each
finger, marking the depth to which they
had sunk. Now to remove this derangement,
the coat of the stomach must be
cleared, which is done by the invisible
fingers scraping all the internal surface.</p>

<p>You have here the whole sum and substance
of a secret for which a hundred
guineas were originally paid by aspirants,
and which was afterwards published at
five guineas by subscription. The list of
subscribers contains the names of some
nobles and of one bishop; but it is short,
and for that reason I suppose the second
and third parts, which were to contain new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
systems of anatomy and midwifery, as improved
by this new science, were never
published.</p>

<p>It follows incontrovertibly from the
principles which have been advanced, that
as the practitioners in this art heal diseases,
so they can communicate them; that they
can give the itch by shaking with invisible
hands, and send a fit of the gout to any
person whom they are disposed to oblige.
The Indian jongleurs, who, like these English
impostors, affect to feel the same pain
as the patient, lay claim to this power; but
it did not answer the purposes of imposture
here to pretend to a power of doing mischief.</p>

<h2>LETTER LII.</h2>

<p class="gist"><i>Blasphemous Conclusion of Mainauduc's
Lectures.—The Effects which he produced
explained.—Disappearance of the Imposture.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">T</span><span class="smc">he</span>
conclusion of the extraordinary book
from whence I have condensed the summary
of this prodigious quackery, is even
more extraordinary and more daring than
the quackery itself. It may be transcribed
without offence to religion, for every
catholic will regard its atrocious impiety
with due abhorrence.</p>

<p>"I flatter myself," says this man at the
close of his lectures, "you are now convinced
that this science is of too exalted
a nature to be trifled with or despised; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">{332}</a></span>
I fondly hope that even the superficial
specimen which you have thus far received
has given you room to suppose it, not a
human device, held out for the sportive
gratification of the idle moment, but a divine
call from the affectionate creating
Parent, inviting his rebellious children by
every persuasive, by every tender motive,
to renounce the destructive allurements of
earthly influence, and to perform the duties
which he sent his beloved Son into the world
to inculcate, as the only and effectual conditions
on which the deluded spirit in man
should escape future punishment. The
apostles received and accepted of those
terms; disciples out of number embraced
the doctrine, and by example, by discourse,
and by cures, influenced the minds
of the unthinking multitude, absorbed in
sin, and rioting in obstinate disobedience.—Again,
the Almighty Father deigns to
rouse his children from that indifference to
their impending fate, into which the watchful
enemy omits no opportunity of enticing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
them. To lead our Saviour from his duty,
the tempter showed and offered him all
this world's grandeur;—so he daily in some
degree does to us. Our Saviour spurned
him with contempt, and so must we. Our
blessed Saviour, whose spirit was a stranger
to sin, cured by perfect spiritual and
physical innocence, and by an uninterrupted
dependence on his Great, Omnipotent,
Spiritual Father. He never failed.
His chosen apostles cured by relinquishing
this world and following him. We have
but one example, that I can recollect, of
their having failed, and then Christ told
them what was necessary to ensure success.
The disciples and the followers of the apostles
performed many cures, but how far
they were checquered by failures I am not
informed. Paracelsus, Sir Kenelm Digby,
Sir Robert Fludd, and several others,
experienced sufficient power in themselves
to verify the words of our Saviour;
but were soon deprived of what was only
lent to urge them to seek for the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
original cause. "Verily, verily," said
Christ, "the works which I do shall ye do
also; and greater works than these shall
ye do, for I go unto my father." Valentine
Greatrakes, by obeying the instructions
imparted to him in visions, performed
many cures; but ceasing to look up to the
source, and giving way to medical importunity,
he administered drugs, and could not
expect success. Gasner, a moral and religious
man, performed many cures; he was
shut up in a convent, through the ignorance
of his superiors, and the superstitious blindness
of the age he lived in; thence his progress
was trivial, though his dawnings seemed
to promise much. Mesmer pillaged the
subject from Sir Robert Fludd, and found
to a certainty the existence of the power:
undisposed to attend to our Saviour's information,
he preferred loadstones and magnetic
ideas to the service of the Great
Author; and after performing several accidental
cures, his magnetism and his errors
shared the fate of his predecessors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">{335}</a></span>
Doctor D'Eslon, his partner, though a
man of strong reason and impartiality,
ascribed the power which he experienced
to the physical will of man; and after performing
some cures, he fell asleep. At
length, after so many centuries of ignorance,
it has graciously pleased the Almighty
Father to draw aside the veil, and
disclose his sacred mysteries to this favoured
generation. And when I shall be
called home, it will, I hope, appear, that
for a bright and happy certainty of serving
my God, and living with my Saviour, I
pointed out to you, my brethren, the Almighty's
real science, and that path to
Heaven, which Christ, <i>the only perfect and
successful one of this list</i>, left to mankind,
as his last testament, and inestimable dying
gift."<span class="fnanchor"><a

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
This portentous blasphemy shows to
what excess any kind of impiety may be
carried on in this country, provided it does
not appear as a direct attack upon religion.
So infamous an impostor would in our
country quickly have been silenced by the
Holy Office, or, to speak more truly, the
salutary dread of the Holy Office would
have restrained him within decent bounds.
Was he pure rogue undiluted with any
mixture of enthusiasm, or did he, contrary
to the ordinary process, begin in rogue,
and end in enthusiast?</p>

<p>It is a common observation, that a man
may tell a story of his own invention so
often that he verily believes it himself at
last. There is more than this in the present
case. Mainauduc pretended to possess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
an extraordinary power over the bodily
functions of others: it was easy to
hire patients at first who would act as he
prescribed, and much was to be expected
afterwards from credulity; but that it
should prove that he actually did possess
this power in as great a degree as he ever
pretended, over persons not in collusion
with him, nor prepared to be affected by
their previous belief, but unprejudiced,
incredulous, reasonable people, philosophical
observers who went to examine and
detect the imposition, in sound health of
body and mind, was more than he expected,
and perhaps more than he could explain.
This actually was the case; they
who went to hear him with a firm and
rational disbelief, expecting to be amused
by the folly of his patients, were themselves
thrown into what is called <i>the crisis</i>:
his steady looks and continued gesticulations
arrested their attention, made them
dizzy, deranged the ordinary functions of
the system, and fairly deprived them for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
a time of all voluntary power, and all perception.</p>

<p>How dangerous a power this was, and
to what detestable purposes it might be
applied, need not be explained. The solution
is easy and convincing, but it by no
means follows that he himself comprehended
it. If we direct our attention to
the involuntary operations of life within us,
they are immediately deranged. Think
for a minute upon the palpitation of the
heart, endeavour to feel the peristaltic
motion, or breathe by an act of volition,
and you disturb those actions which the
life within us carries on unerringly, and
as far as we can perceive unconsciously.
Any person may make the experiment, and
satisfy himself. The animal magnetists
kept up this unnatural state of attention
long enough by their treatment to produce
a suspension of these involuntary motions,
and consequent insensibility.</p>

<p>In a country like this, where the government
has no discretionary power of interfering,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span>
to punish villany, and of course
where whosoever can invent a new roguery
may practise it with impunity, till a new
law be made to render it criminal, Mainauduc
might have gone on triumphantly,
and have made himself the head of a sect,
or even a religion, had the times been favourable.
But politics interfered, and took
off the attention of all the wilder and busier
spirits. He died, and left a woman
to succeed him in the chair. The female
caliph either wanted ability to keep the
believers together, or having made a fortune
thought it best to retire from trade.
So the school was broken up. Happily
for some of the disciples, who could not
exist without a constant supply of new
miracles to feed their credulity, Richard
Brothers appeared, who laid higher claims
than Mainauduc, and promised more wonderful
things. But of him hereafter.</p>

of re-translating it from D. Manuel's Spanish.
With much difficulty he succeeded in finding the
book: it is a large thin quarto volume, printed in
1798, with a portrait of Mainauduc from a picture

<h2>LETTER LIII.</h2>

<p class="gist"><i>Methodists.—Wesley and Whitfield.—Different
Methods of attacking the Establishment.—Tithes.—Methodism
approaches
Popery, and paves the Way for it.—William
Huntingdon, S. S.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="x-large">I</span><span class="smc">n</span>
the year 1729 a great rent was made in
the ragged robe of heresy. Wesley and
Whitfield were the Luther and Calvin of
this schism, which will probably, at no
very remote time, end in the overthrow of
the Established Heretical Church.</p>

<p>They began when young men at Oxford
by collecting together a few persons who
were of serious dispositions like themselves,
meeting together in prayer, visiting
the prisoners, and communicating
whenever the sacrament was administered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></span>
Both took orders in the Establishment,
and for awhile differed only from their
brethren by preaching with more zeal.
But they soon outwent them in heresy
also, and began to preach of the inefficacy
and worthlessness of good works, and of
the necessity of being born again, a doctrine
which they perverted into the wildest
enthusiasm. The new birth they affirmed
was to take place instantaneously, and to
be accompanied with an assurance of salvation;
but throes and agonies worse than
death were to precede it. The effect which
they produced by such a doctrine, being
both men of burning fanaticism, and of
that kind of eloquence which suited their
hearers, is wonderful. They had no sooner
convinced their believers of the necessity
of this new birth, than instances enough
took place. The people were seized with
demoniacal convulsions; shrieks and yells
were set up by frantic women; men fell
as if shot through the heart; and after
hours of such sufferings and contortions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">{342}</a></span>
as required the immediate aid either of the
exorcist or the beadle, they became assured
that they were born again, and fully certain
that their redemption was now sealed.</p>

<p>There may have been some trick in these
exhibitions, but that in the main there
was no wilful deception is beyond a doubt.
<i>Duæ res</i>, says St Augustine, <i>faciunt in
homine omnia peccata, timor scilicet et cupiditas:
timor facit fugere omnia quæ sunt
carni molesta; cupiditas facit habere omnia
quæ sunt carni suavia</i>. These powerful
passions were excited in the most powerful
degree. They terrified their hearers as
children are terrified by tales of apparitions,
and the difference of effect was according
to the difference of the dose, just as the
drunkenness produced by brandy is more
furious than that which is produced by
wine. All those affections which are half-mental,
half-bodily, are contagious;—yawning,
for instance, is always, and
laughter frequently so. When one person
was thus violently affected, it was like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">{343}</a></span>
jarring a string in a room full of musical
instruments. The history of all opinions
evinces that there are epidemics of the
mind.</p>

<p>Such scenes could not be tolerated in
the churches. They then took to the
streets and fields, to the utter astonishment
of the English clergy, who in their
ignorance cried out against this as a novelty.
Had these men, happily for themselves,
been born in a catholic country, it is
most probable that they might indeed have
been burning and shining lights. Their
zeal, their talents, and their intrepid and
indefatigable ardour, might have made
them saints instead of heresiarchs, had
they submitted themselves to the unerring
rule of faith, instead of blindly trusting to
their own perverted judgments. It was
of such men, and of such errors, that
St Leo the Great said: <i>In hanc insipientiam
cadunt, qui cum ad cognoscendam
veritatem aliquo impediuntur obscuro, non
ad Propheticas voces, non ad Apostolicas</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">{344}</a></span>
<i>literas, nec ad Evangelicas auctoritates, sed
ad semetipsos recurrunt; sed ideo magistri
erroris existunt, quia veritatis discipuli non
fuere</i>.</p>

<p>Thousands and tens of thousands flocked
to hear them; and the more they were
opposed the more rapidly their converts
increased. Riots were raised against them
in many places, which were frequently
abetted by the magistrates. There is a
good anecdote recorded of the mayor of
Tiverton, who was advised to follow Gamaliel's
advice, and leave the Methodists
(as they are called) and their religion to
themselves. "What, sir!" said he: "Why,
what reason can there be for any new religion
in Tiverton? another way of going
to Heaven when there are so many already?
Why, sir, there's the Old Church
and the New Church, that's one religion;
there's Parson Kiddell's at the Pitt Meeting,
that's two; Parson Westcott's in Peter
Street, that's three; and old Parson Terry's
in Newport Street, is four.—Four ways of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">{345}</a></span>
going to Heaven already!—and if they
won't go to Heaven by one or other of
these ways, by <span class="squash">——</span> they sha'n't go to
Heaven at all from Tiverton, while I am
mayor of the town."—The outrages of the
mob became at length so violent that the
sufferers appealed to the laws for protection,
and from that time they have remained
unmolested.</p>

<p>The two leaders did not long agree.
Wesley had deliberately asserted, that no
good works can be done before justification,
none which have not in them the nature
of sin,—the abominable doctrine which
the Bonzes of Japan preach in honour of
their deity Amida! Whitfield added to
this the predestinarian heresy, at once the
most absurd and most blasphemous that
ever human presumption has devised. The
Methodists divided under these leaders
into the two parties of Arminians and
Calvinists. Both parties protested against
separating from the Church, though they
were excluded from the churches. Wesley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">{346}</a></span>
however, who was the more ambitious of
the two, succeeded in establishing a new
church government, of which he was the
heretical pope. There was no difficulty
in obtaining assistants; he admitted lay
preachers, and latterly administered ordination
himself. The œconomy of his
church is well constructed. He had felt
how greatly the people are influenced by
novelty, and thus experimentally discovered
one of the causes why the Established
clergy produced so little effect. His
preachers, therefore, are never to remain
long in one place. A double purpose is
answered by this; a perpetual succession
of preachers keeps up that stimulus without
which the people would relapse into
conformity, and the preachers themselves
are prevented from obtaining in any place
that settled and rooted influence which
would enable them to declare themselves
independent of Wesley's Connection (as
the sect is called), and open shop for
themselves. An hundred of these itinerants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">{347}</a></span>
compose the Conference, which is an
annual assembly, the cortes or council of
these heretics, or, like our national councils,
both in one; wherein the state of their
numbers and funds is reported and examined,
stations appointed for the preachers,
and all the affairs of the society regulated.
The authority of the preachers
is strengthened by the system of confession,—confession
without absolution, and
so perverted as to be truly mischievous.
Every parish is divided into small classes,
in which the sexes are separated, and also
the married and the single. The members
of each class are mutually to confess to
and question each other, and all are to
confess to the priest, to whom also the
leader of each class is to report the state
of each individual's conscience. The leader
also receives the contributions, which
he delivers to the stewards. The whole
kingdom is divided into districts, to each
of which there is an assistant or bishop
appointed, who oversees all the congregations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">{348}</a></span>
within his limits; and thus the conference,
which is composed of these assistants
and preachers, possesses a more intimate
knowledge of all persons under their
influence than ever was yet effected by any
system of police, how rigorous soever.</p>

<p>While Wesley lived his authority was
unlimited. He resolutely asserted it, and
the right was acknowledged. It was supposed
that his death would lead to the dissolution
of the body, or at least a schism;
but it produced no change. The absolute
empire which he had exercised passed at
once into a republic, or rather oligarchy
of preachers, without struggle or difficulty,
and their numbers have continued to increase
with yearly accelerating rapidity.
He lived to the great age of eighty-eight,
for more than fifty years of which he had
risen at four o'clock, preached twice and
sometimes thrice a day, and travelled between
four and five thousand miles every
year, being seldom or never a week in the
same place; and yet he found leisure to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">{349}</a></span>
be one of the most voluminous writers in
the language. The body lay in state for
several days,—in his gown and band in the
coffin, where it was visited by forty or
fifty thousand persons, constables attending
to maintain order. It was buried before
break of day, to prevent the accidents
which undoubtedly would else have taken
place. For many weeks afterward a curious
scene was exhibited at his different
chapels, where the books of the society are
always sold. One was crying "The true
and genuine life of Mr Wesley!" another
bawling against him, "This is the real
life!" and a third vociferating to the people
to beware of spurious accounts, and
buy the authentic one from him.</p>

<p>Wesley had no wish to separate from
the Establishment, and for many years he
and his preachers opened their meeting-houses
only at hours when there was no
service in the churches. This is no longer
the case, and the two parties are now at
open war. The Methodists gain ground;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">{350}</a></span>
their preachers are indefatigable in making
converts: but there is no instance of any
person's becoming a convert to the Establishment;—waifs
and strays from other
communities fall into it, such as rich
Presbyterians, who are tempted by municipal
honours, and young Quakers who forsake
their sect because they choose to dress
in the fashion and frequent the theatre;
but no persons join it from conviction.
The meeting-houses fill by draining the
churches, of which the Methodists will
have no scruple to take possession when
they shall become the majority, because
they profess to hold the same tenets, and
to have no objection to the discipline.</p>

<p>The Whitfield party go a surer way to
work. They assert that they hold the
articles of the Church of England, which
the clergy themselves do not; and therefore
they cry out against the clergy as
apostates and interlopers. The truth is,
that the articles of this Church are Calvinistic,
and that, heretical as the clergy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">{351}</a></span>
are, they are not so heretical as they would
be if they adhered to them. The Whitfield
Methodists, therefore, aim, step by
step, at supplanting the Church. They
have funds for educating hopeful subjects
and purchasing church-livings for them,
simony being practised with little or no
disguise in this country, where every thing
has its price. Thus have they introduced
a clamorous and active party into the
Church, who, under the self-assumed title
of Evangelical or Gospel Preachers, cry
out for reform—for the letter of the articles—and
are preparing to eject their supiner
colleagues. In parishes where these conforming
Calvinists have not got possession
of the church, they have their meetings,
and they have also their county
rovers, who itinerate like their Wesley-brethren.
The Calvinistic dissenters are
gradually incorporating with them, and
will in a few generations disappear.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which both these bodies
continue to increase may well alarm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">{352}</a></span>
the regular clergy; but they having been
panic-struck by the French Revolution and
Dr Priestley, think of nothing but Atheists
and Socinians, and are insensible of the
danger arising from this domestic enemy.
The Methodists have this also in their favour,
that while the end at which they are
aiming is not seen, the immediate reformation
which they produce is manifest.
They do, what the Clergy are equally
pledged to do, but neglect doing;—they
keep a watchful eye over the morals of
their adherents, and introduce habits of
sobriety, order, and honesty. The present
good, which is very great, is felt by those
who do not perceive that these people lay
claim to infallibility, and that intolerance
is inseparable from that awful attribute
which they have usurped.</p>

<p>The Establishment is in danger from
another cause. For many years past the
farmers have murmured at the payment of
tithes;—a sin of old times, which has
been greatly aggravated by the consequences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">{353}</a></span>
of the national schism: since the
gentry have turned farmers these murmurs
have become louder, and associations have
been formed for procuring the abolishment
of tithes, on the ground that they
impede agricultural improvements. Government
has lent ear to these representations,
and it is by no means improbable
that it will one day avail itself of this
pretext, to sell the tithes, as the land-tax
has already been sold, and fund the money;—that
is, make use of it for its own
exigencies, and give the clergy salaries,—thus
reducing them to be pensioners of
the state. The right of assembling in a
house of their own they have suffered to
lapse; and they have suffered also without a
struggle, a law to be passed declaring them
incapable of sitting in the House of Commons;—which
law was enacted merely for
the sake of excluding an obnoxious individual.
There will, therefore, be none but
the bishops to defend their rights,—but
the bishops look up to the crown for promotion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">{354}</a></span>
If such a measure be once proposed,
the Dissenters will petition in its
favour, and the farmers will all rejoice in
it, forgetting that if the tenth is not paid
to the priest it must to the landholder,
whom they know by experience to be the
more rigid collector of the two. When the
constitutional foundations of the church
are thus shaken, the Methodists, who have
already a party in the legislature, will come
forward, and offer a national church at a
cheaper rate, which they will say is the
true Church of England, because it adheres
to the letter of the canons. I know not
what is to save the heretical establishment,
unless government should remember that
when the catholic religion was pulled
down, it brought down the throne in its
fall.</p>

<p>It is not the nature of man to be irreligious;
he listens eagerly to those who
promise to lead him to salvation, and welcomes
those who come in the name of the
Lord with a warmth of faith, which makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">{355}</a></span>
it the more lamentable that he should so
often be deluded. How then is it that the
English clergy have so little hold upon the
affections of the people? Partly it must be
their own fault, partly the effect of that
false system upon which they are established.
Religion here has been divested
both of its spirit and its substance—what
is left is neither soul nor body, but the
spectral form of what once had both, such
as old chemists pretended to raise from the
ashes of a flower, or the church-yard apparitions,
which Gaffarel explains by this
experiment. There is nothing here for the
senses, nothing for the imagination,—no
visible object of adoration, at which piety
shall drink, as at a fountain of living waters.
The church service here is not a
propitiatory sacrifice, and it is regarded
with less reverence for being in the vulgar
tongue, being thereby deprived of all that
mysteriousness which is always connected
with whatever is unknown. When the
resident priest is a man of zeal and beneficence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">{356}</a></span>
his personal qualities counteract
the deadening tendency of the system;
these qualities are not often found united;
it is true that sometimes they are found, and
that then it is scarcely possible to conceive
a man more respected or more useful than
an English clergyman—(saving always his
unhappy heresy)—but it is also true that
the clergy are more frequently inactive;
that they think more of receiving their
dues than of discharging their duty; that
the rector is employed in secular business
and secular amusements instead of looking
into the spiritual concerns of his flock,
and that his deputy the curate is too much
upon a level with the poor to be respected
by them. The consequence is, that they
are yielding to the Methodists without a
struggle, and that the Methodists are preparing
the way for the restoration of the
true church. Beelzebub is casting out
Beelzebub. They are doing this in many
ways: they have taught the people the necessity
of being certain of their own salvation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">{357}</a></span>
but there is no certainty upon
which the mind can rest except it be upon
the absolving power of an infallible church;
they have reconciled them to a belief that
the age of miracles is not past,—no saint
has recorded so many of himself as Wesley;
and they have broken them in to the
yoke of confession, which is what formerly
so intolerably galled their rebellious
necks. Whatever, in fact, in methodism is
different from the established church, is
to be found in the practices of the true
church; its pretensions to novelty are fallacious;
it has only revived what here, unhappily,
had become obsolete, and has
worsened whatever it has altered. Hence
it is that they make converts among every
people except the Catholics; which makes
them say, in their blindness, that atheism
is better than popery, for of an atheist
there is hope, but a papist is irreclaimable:—that
is, they can overthrow the sandy
foundations of human error, but not the
rock of truth. Our priests have not found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">{358}</a></span>
them so invincible; a nephew of Wesley
himself, the son of his brother and colleague,
was, in his own life-time, reclaimed,
and brought within the fold of the Church.</p>

<p>Wesley was often accused of being a
Jesuit;—would to Heaven the imputation
had been true! but his abominable opinions
respecting good works made a gulf
between him and the church as wide as
that between Dives and Lazarus. Perhaps,
if it had not been for this accusation, he
would have approached still nearer to it,
and enjoined celibacy to his preachers, instead
of only recommending it.</p>

<p>The paroxysms and epilepsies of enthusiasm
are now no longer heard of among
these people,—good proof that they were
real in the beginning of the sect. Occasionally
an instance happens, and when it
begins the disease runs through the particular
congregation; this is called a great
revival of religion in that place, but there
it ends. Such instances are rare, and
groaning and sobbing supply the place of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">{359}</a></span>
fits and convulsions. I know a lady who
was one day questioning a beggar woman
concerning her way of life, and the woman
told her she had been one of my lady's
groaners, which she explained by saying
that she was hired at so much a week to
attend at Lady Huntingdon's chapel, and
groan during the sermon. The countess
of Huntingdon was the great patroness of
Whitfield, and his preachers were usually
called by her name,—which they have now
dropt for the better title of Evangelicals.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the precautions which
the Methodists have taken to keep their
preachers dependent upon the general
body, the standard of revolt is sometimes
erected; and a successful rebel establishes
a little kingdom of his own. One of these
independent chieftains has published an
account of himself, which he calls God
the Guardian of the Poor and the Bank of
Faith. His name is William Huntington,
and he styles himself S. S. which signifies
Sinner Saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">{360}</a></span>
The tale which this man tells is truly
curious. He was originally a coal-heaver,
one of those men whose occupation and
singular appearance I have noticed in a
former letter; but finding praying and
preaching a more promising trade, he ventured
upon the experiment of living by
faith alone, and the experiment has answered.
The man had talents, and soon
obtained hearers. It was easy to let them
know, without asking for either, that he
relied upon them for food and clothing.
At first supplies came in slowly,—a pound
of tea and a pound of sugar at a time, and
sometimes an old suit of clothes. As he
got more hearers they found out that it
was for their credit he should make a better
appearance in the world. If at any
time things did not come when they were
wanted, he prayed for them, knowing well
where his prayers would be heard. As a
specimen, take a story which I shall annex
in his own words, that the original may
prove the truth of the translation, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">{361}</a></span>
might else not unreasonably be suspected.</p>

<p>"Having now had my horse for some
time, and riding a great deal every week,
I soon wore my <i>breeches</i> out, as they were
not fit to ride in. I hope the reader will
excuse my mentioning the word <i>breeches</i>,
which I should have avoided, had not this
passage of scripture obtruded into my
mind, just as I had resolved in my own
thoughts not to mention this kind providence
of God. 'And thou shalt make
linen breeches to cover their nakedness;
from the loins even unto the thighs shall
they reach,' &amp;c. Exod. xxviii. 42, 43. By
which and three others, (namely, Ezek.
xliv. 18; Lev. vi. 10; and Lev. xvi. 4.)
I saw that it was no crime to mention the
word <i>breeches</i>, nor the way in which God
sent them to me; Aaron and his sons
being clothed entirely by Providence; and
as God himself condescended to give orders
what they should be made of, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">{362}</a></span>
how they should be cut, and I believe the
same God ordered mine, as I trust it will
appear in the following history.</p>

<p>"The scripture tells us to call no man
master, for one is our master, even Christ.
I therefore told my most bountiful and
ever-adored master what I wanted; and
he, who stripped Adam and Eve of their
fig-leaved aprons, and made coats of skins
and clothed them; and who clothes the
grass of the field, which to-day is, and tomorrow
is cast into the oven; must clothe
us, or we shall soon go naked; and so
Israel found it when God took away his
wool, and his flax, which they prepared
for Baal: for which iniquity was their
skirts discovered, and their heels made
bare. Jer. xiii. 22.</p>

<p>"I often made very free in my prayers
with my valuable Master for this favour,
but he still kept me so amazingly poor
that I could not get them at any rate. At
last I was determined to go to a friend of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">{363}</a></span>
mine at Kingston, who is of that branch
of business, to bespeak a pair; and to get
him to trust me until my Master sent me
money to pay him. I was that day going
to London, fully determined to bespeak
them as I rode through the town. However,
when I passed the shop I forgot it;
but when I came to London I called on
Mr Croucher, a shoemaker in Shepherd's
Market, who told me a parcel was left
there for me, but what it was he knew
not. I opened it, and behold there was a
pair of <i>leather breeches</i> with a note in
them! the substance of which was, to the
best of my remembrance, as follows:</p>

<div class="top">
<div class="left2">"'<span class="smc">sir</span>,</div>
</div>

<p>"'I have sent you a pair of breeches, and
hope they will fit. I beg your acceptance
of them; and, if they want any alteration,
leave in a note what the alteration is, and
I will call in a few days and alter them.</p>

<div class="foot">
<div class="right2">'J. S.'</div>
</div>

<p>"'I tried them on, and they fitted as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">{364}</a></span>
as if I had been measured for them: at
which I was amazed, having never been
measured by any leather-breeches maker
in London. I wrote an answer to the note
to this effect:</p>

<div class="top">
<div class="left2">"'<span class="smc">sir</span>,</div>
</div>

<p>"'I received your present, and thank
you for it. I was going to order a pair of
leather breeches to be made, because I did
not know till now that my Master had bespoke
them of you. They fit very well;
which fully convinces me that the same
God, who moved thy heart to give, guided
thy hand to cut; because he perfectly
knows my size, having clothed me in a
miraculous manner for near five years.
When you are in trouble, sir, I hope you
will tell my Master of this, and what you
have done for me, and he will repay you
with honour.'</p>

<p>"This is as nearly as I am able to relate
it; and I added:</p>

<p>"'I cannot make out I. S. unless I put
I. for Israelite indeed, and S. for Sincerity;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">{365}</a></span>
because you did not 'sound a trumpet before
you, as the hypocrites do.'</p>

<p>"About that time twelvemonth I got
another pair of breeches in the same extraordinary
manner, without my ever being
measured for them."</p>

<p>Step by step, by drawing on his Master,
as he calls him, and persuading the congregation
to accept his draft, this Sinner
Saved has got two chapels of his own, a
house in the country, and a coach to carry
him backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>My curiosity was greatly excited to see
the author of this book, which is not only
curious for the matter which it contains,
but is also written with much unaffected
originality. I went accordingly to Providence
Chapel. It has three galleries, built
one above another like a theatre; for, when
he wanted to enlarge it, an exorbitant
ground-rent was demanded: "So," says
the doctor, as he calls himself, "<i>the heavens,
even the heavens, are the Lord's; but the
earth hath he given to the children of men</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">{366}</a></span>
—Finding nothing could be done with the
<i>earth-holders</i>, I turned my eyes another
way, and determined to build my <i>stories
in the heaven</i> (Amos ix. 6.), where I should
find more room, and less rent." The place,
however, notwithstanding its great height,
was so crowded, that I could with difficulty
find standing room in the door-way.
The doctor was throned on high in the
middle of the chapel,—in a higher pulpit
than I have ever seen elsewhere: he is a
fat, little-eyed man, with a dew-lap at his
chin, and a velvet voice; who, instead of
straining himself by speaking loud, enforces
what he says more easily by a significant
nod of the head. St Jerome has
almost prophetically described him,—<i>ante
nudo eras pede, modo non solum calceato,
sed et ornato: tunc pexâ tunicâ, et nigrâ
subuculâ vestiebaris sordidatus, et pallidus,
et callosam opere gestitans manum, nunc
lineis et sericis vestibus, et Atrabatum et
Laodiceæ indumentis ornatus incedis; rubent
buccæ, nitet cutis, comæ in occipitium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">{367}</a></span>
frontemque tornantur, protensus est aqualiculus,
insurgunt humeri, turget guttur,
et de obesis faucibus vix suffocata verba
promuntur</i>. His congregation looked as if
they were already so near the fire and
brimstone, that the fumes had coloured
their complexions. They had as distinct
a physiognomy as the Jews, with a dismal
expression of spiritual pride in it, as if they
firmly believed in the reprobation of every
body except themselves.</p>

<p>It would be rash, and probably unjust,
to call this man a rogue. He may fancy
himself to be really divinely favoured, because,
like Elijah, he is fed by ravens,—not
remembering that his ravens are tame
ones, whom he has trained to bring him
food. The success of his own pretensions
may make him believe them. Thus it is:
the poor solitary madman who calls himself
Ambassador from the Man in the
Moon, is confined as a madman, because
he can persuade nobody to believe him;—but
he who calls himself Ambassador from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">{368}</a></span>
the Lord is credited, and suffered to go at
large; the moment that madness becomes
contagious it is safe!</p>

<p>Huntington's success has occasioned
imitators, one of whom, who had formerly
been a drover of cattle, insisted upon
having a carriage also; he obtained it, and
in imitation of the S. S. placed upon it
A. J. C. for Ambassador of Jesus Christ!
Then he called upon his congregation for
horses, and now threatens to leave them
because they are so unreasonable as to demur
at finding corn for them. The proof,
he says, of their being true Christians is
their readiness to support the preachers of
the Gospel. Another of these fellows told
his congregation one day after service,
that he wanted 300<i>l.</i> for the work of the
Lord, and must have it directly. They
subscribed what money they had about
them, and some would then have gone
home for more;—he said No, that would
not do; he wanted it immediately, and
they must go into the vestry and give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">{369}</a></span>
checks upon their hankers—which they
obediently did.—And the English call us
a priest-ridden people!</p>

<p>Morality, says one of these faith-preachers—is
the great Antichrist. There
are two roads to the devil, which are
equally sure; the one is by profaneness,
the other by good works; and the devil
likes the latter way best, because people
expect to be saved by it, and so are taken
in.—You will smile at all this, and say</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
